		<description>Thanks for reading, Sam! 

Yeah, I think part of it is just plugging away at content marketing as a strategy.  For us, we&#039;re still relatively new to finding our voice in content marketing, and I think it takes time.  We&#039;ll see how this goes for us.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the tips Elizabeth. Just put on SumoMe yesterday on our blog so we&#039;re still to see if it&#039;ll bring in anything. What I&#039;ll say though after several months reading about tactics that work or AppSumo/Buffer is that they, well, seem to work just for those guys :D Which either means they have traffic enough to always have some return with their tactics or our visitors are very stingy with their emails. Your pick.

Ps: That header leadbox is looking awesome</description>
