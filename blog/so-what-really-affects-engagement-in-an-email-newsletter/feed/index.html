		<description>Hi Jay, 

Certainly.  In this case, click-through-rate is not referring to a particular link.  Say you have 5 links in a newsletter.  A click is counted in this ratio if a person clicks on any of those links.  the click-through-rate ratio is total number of clicks to total number of sends.  (Sometimes, though, email service providers will calculate it as total number of clicks to total number of opens)</description>

		<description>Hello,

Could you please explain what you mean by &quot;click-through-rate&quot; in this context?

I am familiar with CTR in the traditional sense (i.e. CTR on an ad) - but when talking about newsletters, do you mean, for instance, clicking through to read the full article, clicking through to an offer, a related link, etc.?

Thank you!</description>
