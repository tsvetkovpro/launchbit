		<description>Hi Sam -- for a first pass, you should probably put it together yourself so that it has your voice and the material that would be good for your target demographic.  When you get down to the final stages, it might be worthwhile to find someone who can help you with the layout and titles.  It might be also worthwhile to find an editor, but one of key things about ebooks is aesthetics over wording/diction.</description>
