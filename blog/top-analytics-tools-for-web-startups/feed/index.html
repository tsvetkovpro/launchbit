		<description>Sure!  Depended on the product.  For all of our sites that were getting really close to being super-good user experiences, we would ask &quot;How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use this product?&quot; (http://startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/)  This would help us assess if people thought our site was actually awesome.But, some other questions we&#039;ve asked have included: &quot;What other products would you like to see here.&quot;  &quot;What frustrations do you have in going through XYZ?&quot;  And, we&#039;ve even asked people to refer their friends. :)</description>
