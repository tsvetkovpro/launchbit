		<description>Thanks for the tip, Peter!  Yeah, the audio was less than ideal for this one...  This happened, because we were doing a joint webinar with Tout, and they dialed us in, so I sound rather &quot;tinny.&quot;  We weren&#039;t sure how we could jointly record via computer.  Lots of room for improvement... :)</description>

		<description>Yeah, most webinar services offer recording now, which is very handy.

That said, if I&#039;m doing one, I&#039;ll also run up Screenflow (Mac) and record my own local screen and audio and just use the webinar tools as a backup. The main reason is you get crystal clear audio and smooth video (especially if you do any screen sharing) rather than it sounding like someone talking over the phone. A minor point, but can be quite good if sharing on YouTube is a big part of the plan (not so much otherwise) because some people will always complain about the audio(!)</description>

		<description>Thanks, Rick!  I&#039;m so sorry you weren&#039;t able to get into the webinar.  Hmm...we&#039;ll need to look into why that is -- I suspect we hit our max # of attendees, and we didn&#039;t expect so many people.  

MeetingBurner is the software we used to hold this webinar.  It records a video, and the Tout team did some post-production on the video to add the music and cut down on pauses.  Then, they uploaded the video to YouTube, and this is an embedded YouTube video.</description>

		<description>How do you take a recording of a webinar and offer it after the fact?  An archive in your website or a link to YouTube?  Also, I couldn&#039;t find out how to get on your webinar when it was time so I am glad you sent this today.  I would like to send out recordings of webinars/collaboration calls to those who signed up and couldn&#039;t make it or those who didn&#039;t even sign up for it in the first place - perhaps due to a scheduling conflict.
Thanks, Rick.</description>
