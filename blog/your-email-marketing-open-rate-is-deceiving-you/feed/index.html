		<description>Hi Stolph -- we&#039;re talking about overall open rate in this case.  Interesting point -- we haven&#039;t looked at unique opens, but I would guess that the behavior would be similar in its decline over time.</description>

		<description>Nice article.  When you talk of open rates, do you mean unique opens or total number of opens?  Those two numbers are very different for me.  11% vs. 20%.  Thanks!</description>
