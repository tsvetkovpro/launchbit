		<description>Hey Taylor -- great question.  We&#039;ve seen both in our network, and in talking with advertisers, we&#039;ve found that for *most* advertisers, driving sign ups to a free trial or a free package doesn&#039;t work well.  :(  I suspect that B2B customers are just not particularly price sensitive.  They are more concerned about spending their time effectively and using products that solve problems.  So, even if you are throwing all kinds of free stuff at them, if it&#039;s not useful, they won&#039;t sign up.  

That said, we do also have advertisers who find success in driving free trials.  I don&#039;t have enough data yet to even conjecture why some Saas companies have more success with the latter while others don&#039;t at all...</description>

		<description>Great article. For companies with a freemium SaaS product, do you still recommend driving paid advertising to a softer CTA (like a HubSpot white paper), or do you consider driving to an install page for the free version of the product? I understand there are lots of factors to consider (I do every day..), but just curious what your thoughts are. 

For example - SEOmoz which offers a 30 day free trial (similar to freemium)</description>

		<description>Thanks, Bernie!  Good questions!

1) I was a bit sloppy here as well.  I assumed that most companies reading this would be Saas companies where COGs are relatively negligible.  I&#039;m not really sure what the numbers should look like for a non-Saas businesses.  I would guess that a good proxy would be to take the LTV - COGs and use that # as your LTV.  This would model your business more like a Saas business.  So, 1/3 seems like a good number to use in your case.  

2) I only know a bit anecdotally.  I hear all kinds of numbers of current and prospective customers when I ask them what success looks like.  For some companies, they want to break even within 6 months.  For others, they aim for a year or a year and a half.  3-4 months is definitely on the faster side from what I hear anecdotally.  

But, for both of these answers, I think it also depends a lot on how well capitalized a company is, too... :)</description>

		<description>Thanks for reading, John.  Sure, I agree... :)  I was rather sloppy in writing this post (so many typos that I don&#039;t have time to fix).  Yes, creative does matter for all cases.  You can&#039;t just put out a bad ad.  

What I meant to say is that, you care less about trying to maximize clicks under PPC platforms than under flat rate or CPM.  If you&#039;re paying CPM, you really want your creative to stand out.  

Yes, you pay more on a CPC system if your CTR is lower.  But again, another sloppy mistake on my part -- I should&#039;ve said lower w/ respect to your competitor ads.  A good portion of CTR is actually attributed to ad format.  

So, pulling this altogether -- say, you&#039;re thinking about taking out an ad on a blog.  And, it&#039;s tucked away in the corner.  If you&#039;re paying on a CPM or flat rate, you really want your ad to stand out because you want to get your money&#039;s worth.  If you&#039;re paying on CPC, say on Google AdWords, you care less about standing out.  Your ad just needs to do better than other ads that could be going in that slot, but it doesn&#039;t mean you have to go above and beyond crazy to stand out.</description>

		<description>Great article Elizabeth! What&#039;s your rule of thumb for 

1) what % your CPA should be of your lifetime profit (not revenue), and 
2) how many months you should target to get &quot;paid back&quot; on your acquisition cost? 

We try to target roughly 1/3 for #1, and 3-4 months for #2. Curious to hear what you&#039;ve seen/heard.</description>

		<description>&quot;If you are using LaunchBit or Google AdWords (or some other performance network), this [type of creative] doesn’t matter, because you are paying only for clicks you receive.&quot;

This isn&#039;t really true.  It still matters what kind of creative you use even on a ppc model.  First, because you want to make sure that the ad encourages the people you want us customers will click the ad and those you don&#039;t want as customers don&#039;t click the ad.  The ad creative can serve as a filter of sorts for potential customers.  Plus, as you mention, if your ad doesn&#039;t encourage enough clicks, then your cost per click will be more.

Good article though.  There&#039;s definitely a lot people who don&#039;t understand the advertising side of things.</description>
