		<description>Thanks..great post!

Would you have Click to open rates (CTOR) instead of click through rates (CTR)? 
Also, do you agree with Statwing finding that there is a possiblity of 25% Click rate with 50% open rates?</description>

		<description>I need to know how to improve our click through rate, on an average our open rates are good but the CTR&#039;s are not that good.  Also please let me know what do you mean by digest style.</description>
