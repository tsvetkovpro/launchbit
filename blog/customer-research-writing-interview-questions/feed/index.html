		<description>Hi Elizabeth, great Article, I learned a lot! but the more I learn the more I get questions.

So I have an idea I want to validate, and I would like to check the pains and personas to focus on them, but I am not sure if I have to ask only behavioral questions or also I should show them the product (I have an app prototype) even if it’s in such an early stage. What do you recommend?</description>
