		<description>Hi Davor - he first started running LaunchBit ads (our ad network for email newsletters).  So, initially, he didn&#039;t need to sell any ads himself.  But, once companies saw that there were advertisers in his newsletter he started getting approached a lot.  And now, he sells a lot of his advertising directly to companies.  He doesn&#039;t have a sales team -- the newsletter largely now sells itself.</description>

		<description>Very nice write up. I would be interested in finding out how he found the advertisers (or if they found him) and so on.</description>
