		<description>Sorry, Dave -- I only just saw your comment.  A few ways:

1) Re: your ebook -- a lot of companies just create pdf files for their ebooks.  I assume you have it in this format already? 

2) Then, create a landing page with information about your ebook.  When people sign up, you&#039;ll have their email address, and you can send them the ebook.  There are a number of landing page builders you can use without writing any code, including Unbounce, Kickoff Labs, and Leadpages.  Hope this helps!</description>

		<description>Price? If I have ebook content compiled in digital form on my computer how do I get into ebook form to be readable?  How do I market my ebook to get the most email leads?
I&#039;m signed up already.</description>
