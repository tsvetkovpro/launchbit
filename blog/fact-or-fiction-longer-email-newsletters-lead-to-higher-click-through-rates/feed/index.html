		<description>Here&#039;s a Basic tip that will increase your chances:

Create Newsletters that cover 3 areas:  Informative, Interaction and Story.  Every reader wants something different.  In fact, they want 7 different things (but that&#039;s another story).  If you just stick with 3 things, then you don&#039;t exhaust them.  Remember the average business person gets 25-50 emails per day.  If you give valid information, you interest the brainiacs.  If you provide a way for them to interact, then you interest the creative.  If you tell a story/bloc, then you interest the heart tug.

Simple easy and helpful.</description>
