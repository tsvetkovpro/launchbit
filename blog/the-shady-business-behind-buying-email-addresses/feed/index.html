		<description>Its 100% legal to send unsolicited emails “as long as” you provide an option for the email recipient to opt-out.  Similarly, it’s 100% legal to send unsolicited direct mail. 

Secondly, millions of companies send unsolicited direct mail … including blue chip companies like Google, Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola, US Government, etc.   And of course 90+ percent of the unsolicited mail is never looked at … thrown in the garbage.  BUT … Google and millions of others continue to send unsolicited direct mail.  Why?   Because it works!    

And like direct mail, the majority of unsolicited email is also thrown in the garbage … BUT even so … companies keep sending unsolicited email.  Why?  Because it works. 

Though I should say it works for some.  For some companies a 1% response rate can represent huge profit.  In other words, if you have a low profit product ... most mediums (direct mail, email, radio, etc) will not work for you.</description>

		<description>Tom, purchasing lists provides marketers with a great opportunity to expand their database. I&#039;ve used Clickback in the past and they&#039;ve produce excellent results for my email campaigns! There&#039;s a live chat tool available on their website for quick answers if you have any questions about their product.</description>

		<description>I highly doubt he paid $18,000 dollars for email addresses. I&#039;ve never seen email addresses for sale for more than $2000 dollars and that gets you over 100 million emails so I find the truth of this article to be somewhat fictitious. If this is true then I have over 20 million dollars waiting in a Nigerian bank account for him! :)</description>

		<description>Say you have a business (B to B)  that is Brokering (Selling) excess inventory for different businesses across the country.  Your suppliers are all over the country and you prospective customers are all over the country.  You are small staff wise, so you need to use email.  Where can you get reliable Email lists that can be parsed by Geographic Code, SIC Code, etc.?

Thanks

		<description>My heart sank when you dropped the $18K bill in there. 

As far as I understand, the CAN-SPAM legislation is legal and thus unsolicited mail is illegal. I could be wrong (I&#039;ve never needed to know this because I&#039;ve never sent dodgy emails).

But I agree that it at least ethically wrong and (almost always) is a stupid idea from a business perspective.

That $18K could have bought a lot of very targetted users through email ads, facebook, banner networks, Linkedin, et al. Such a shame to have wasted it.

But like you, Elizabeth, all I could come up with were different ways to effectively become a spammer and cover your tracks. Not cool. At all.

Another option is to cut your losses and forget about it (Ouch).

Or become a bad guy and sell them on (Even worse).

But then I started to think about those email addresses as a room full of people.
If they had opted into emails, it&#039;d be like you had the stage and they&#039;d all be listening to you.

You haven&#039;t bought a megaphone. You&#039;ve bought a list of attendees with name badges.

You&#039;re at a conference with 38,000 business people who don&#039;t know you from Adam. But you *do* have the opportunity to talk to them 1 to 1. 

So maybe that&#039;s the way to go. 

Work the room. Find out about them (twitter, linkedin, rapportive, some fancy CRM) and work from the ground up. 

Cold calling one by one. Learning about them and building some mojo.

[I&#039;ve never sent cold call emails but the &#039;More Cheese, Less Whiskers&#039; approach makes most sense to me http://ilovemarketing.com/episode-055the-one-where-dan-sullivan-talks-with-dean-about-cheese-and-whiskers/]

It&#039;s slow and painful but the best way to create any real value.

Then again, I&#039;d probably just scrap the whole list and start from scratch with a proper system. 

&quot;Don’t buy email addresses.  It’s not worth it.&quot; -- Right On!</description>

		<description>Hi Troels -- I&#039;d be curious to learn more.  Do you have a source?  The CAN SPAM laws, at least, do not prohibit this.  That said, it&#039;s still a shady business.  :)</description>
