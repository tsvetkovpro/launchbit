		<description>Hmmm...I&#039;m so sorry, Carol!  The popup isn&#039;t supposed to show up so often.  

If you click the little (x) in the upper right corner of the popup, does it go away for good?  Then you should be able to view any of our blog pages (and fill out the form) without the pesky popup...

		<description>Hi, I&#039;m trying to give you my info to receive a free copy of your ebook -- I&#039;ve written my contact info, but it looks like the &quot;reply&quot; button might be covered up by the &quot;newsletter subscribe&quot; popup. BTW, I already receive the newsletter, but i continue to get the popup.
Hope to hear from you with the book. I&#039;ll bet it&#039;s fascinating.
Thanks.
