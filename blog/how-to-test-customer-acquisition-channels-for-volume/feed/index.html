		<description>Greetings!  My wife and I met you in Portland, Maine.  We brought home one of your crtaieons.  As you will see in the attached picture we live in Arizona.  We promised you a picture, so we hope this helps out in your adventure.  We enjoyed talking with you and appreciated your transitioning, after retiring from teaching, to being a entrepreneur.  We hope this winter is not too harsh in Maine.  Good Luck!</description>
