		<description>Oh nice!  Thanks for reading, Sam.  That sounds like a good idea -- do you find that a certain pattern in your tweets works out well for you?</description>

		<description>Split testing didn&#039;t produce much results for me either. What we do though is that we tweet the same post but using different wording: sometimes the original title, sometimes a phrase from it or a question. We just do what I guess Matt (Automattic) put out better than we did, that with each post we blog for two people: the author and one human we don&#039;t know who would really benefit from the post. So that sort of guides how we word the titles and everything.</description>
