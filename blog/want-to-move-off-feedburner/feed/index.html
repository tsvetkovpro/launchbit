		<description>I&#039;d like to second the request for RSS support. I&#039;d like a complete place for my subscribers and would like to be able to ditch FeedBurner altogether.</description>

		<description>Hi Mgoetz -- it will be ads (for bloggers who those want to monetize) and potentially some premium services/functionality.  Email ads is our bread and butter business (launchbit.com), so this is a natural extension for us and aligns nicely with bloggers who want to earn additional revenue.</description>

		<description>Nice idea:) I was quite annoyed by the outage some days ago because it happened exactly when we expected an interesting to see increase of subscribers.
What will be your business model?</description>

		<description>I applied for this, but out of curiosity- will this eventually be opened for bloggers who have standard RSS subscribers through feedburner as well? I have 160 RSS subscribers but no email subscribers (since I&#039;ve been planning to do a newsletter forever, but never got around to it, so didn&#039;t actually activate the email option)- and would love to transfer my RSS subscribers over to a feedburner alternative as well!</description>
