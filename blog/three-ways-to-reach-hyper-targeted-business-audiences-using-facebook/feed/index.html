		<description>Hi Small Business Owner, 

Right now this program is still in beta, so we&#039;re still hashing out some things with our beta customers.  There isn&#039;t a minimum CPC bid, but at this stage, we generally won&#039;t take on a customer as a beta user unless they are able to bid competitively for their category (and all the filters they want).  Our current minimum commitment for all of our ad integrations is $1000/mo spend.  Email us at hello@launchbit.com, and we can figure out if it makes sense to try something at this stage.</description>

		<description>What targeting criteria do you offer to choose from and is there a minimum CPC bid? Does the bid need go higher with more targeting options selected versus more general audience? Is there a minimum commitment level for a trial campaign with LaunchBit?</description>
