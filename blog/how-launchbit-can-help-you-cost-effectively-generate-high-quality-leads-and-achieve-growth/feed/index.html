		<description>This is pretty comomn and I was the same way for a long time. I just didn&#039;t get it. He may actually be being completely honest. And you&#039;re likely saying to yourself,  Could he actually be THAT clueless?!  Yes.What happens in most marriages is this sinister little dance. We&#039;ve seen this in BootCamp more than any other situation. Husband tries to be a good guy and decent husband, but just never had the tools to connect emotionally. Wife doesn&#039;t want to rock the boat, especially while kids are young, so she suffers in silence. She doesn&#039;t speak up for herself. A couple decades go by and there&#039;s nothing there.In that situation, it isn&#039;t just the guy&#039;s fault. It takes two to tango. There are a lot of communication issues to be addressed. Is it fixable? Absolutely. If both spouses are on board and ready to admit they need help. My personal opinion? Your 25th wedding anniversary gift should be a series of sessions with a fantastic marriage therapist. Give yourselves a chance for a really great relationship for the next 25 years.</description>
