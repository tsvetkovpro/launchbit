		<description>Thanks @Andrew.  Nice post!  Yeah, Bill&#039;s great -- I&#039;m familiar with his methods, and he helped walk us through a lot of these exercises.  I agree -- seems totally hokey but so key.  The warm fuzzy stuff usually isn&#039;t for me but I&#039;ve found that really being passionate about a particular space or challenge is super important in getting through the tough times.</description>

		<description>Hi Elizabeth. Great post, particularly as I&#039;m pivoting through different ideas for building a startup from my heart. Like you, I started with trying to pick a vertical, and found that restricting, if not entirely fulfilling. Then I got lucky! Last summer, I got to participate in Bill Warner&#039;s lab about how to find an idea for building a startup from the heart. Thanks to Bill&#039;s gift I&#039;m now happily pivoting from one idea to the next, with every idea resonating with what I&#039;m fundamentally passionate about, and bringing me closer to the ultimate idea for building a startup from my heart. The technique entails filling in 4 sentences. At first, it admittedly seemed hokey, but I&#039;m super happy that I gave it a shot. If interested, I wrote a blog post on the technique: http://drewmcinnes.com/2010/08/4-steps-for-building-a-startup-from-your-heart...&gt;Thanks again!Drew</description>

		<description>@wjg Yeah -- we no longer work on it at all.   Shiny Orb was an easy one to just leave hanging, because it didn&#039;t require customer support, and we didn&#039;t actually have inventory.  So, the site is still up and runs by itself.  We have a parser that automatically gets the latest dresses and adds them while removing dresses that no longer exist.   A lot of brides still find it useful, so it wasn&#039;t too painful to put away.  However, we&#039;ve tried other experiments that were much more hands-on, and those were harder to put to rest.  But, in the end, since we weren&#039;t going to work on those experiments, we had to dump those completely.  And that can be painful.</description>

		<description>Elizabeth, do you have a post describing your current involvement with ShinyOrb? Were you able to reduce your commitment to it?</description>

		<description>Thanks @Rishi!  A big part of the problem is that what I&#039;m passionate about is web development and building useful things.  But, for folks like myself, figuring out a vertical or industry is much harder if that&#039;s primarily what you love.</description>

		<description>Elizabeth! This is a great post about the struggles of discovering your passion.You knew you wanted to be an entrepreneur and start a business... something a lot of people figure out early on in life. Finding your passion takes time and effort - something a lot of people fail to realize. I&#039;m glad you found yours, I can&#039;t wait to see what you accomplish over the next 3-5 years!</description>
