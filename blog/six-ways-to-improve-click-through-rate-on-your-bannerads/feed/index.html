		<description>We have a specific niche and have no problems with click throughs or conversions. We have approximately12 to 18% banner ad on website conversion rates. We no longer use Google ppc and we fully focus on Facebook. Our b2b customers usually find us through organic. We contribute our conversions to having a very narrow niche. &quot;Clothing Boutiques and online resellers&quot; using Facebook. 

Since we started talking about the customer and their needs and their benefits in anything we do textually or graphically, everything changed for the better. It used to be how great we were and what we offer. There is still a little bit of that but the main focus is pain and solutions oriental toward the visitor.</description>
