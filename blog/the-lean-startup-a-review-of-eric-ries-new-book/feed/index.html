		<description>@Bill, I completely agree.  Though similar practices have long been established in other industries, in internet, though, somehow we&#039;ve just never thought to use these practices until now.  It&#039;s nice to see this change happening.</description>

		<description>Eric Reis&#039;s Lean Start-up methodology and Steve Blank&#039;s customer development methodology  are derivations of the Fourth Generation of Innovation (4G) that was first published as a book in 1998 (Fourth Generation R&amp;D) and then practiced by companies such as Samsung. The spiral iterative process involveing pivots of business plans is part of 4G. Whereas  Lean Start-up focuses on IT innovation, 4G methodlology is broader and deeper and therefore 4G applies to all industries and markets. It&#039;s nice to see people rediscover the wheel.</description>

		<description>Hi Tom.  We built our dashboard in-house to do cohort analysis on our #s.  It&#039;s similar to what you can get with RJ Metrics.  We also use a range of 3rd party analytics tools, but none of those tools got us the cohort analysis that we needed to better understand if we were improving.</description>

		<description>You mention building a dashboard towards the end. Did you do this internally or use a tool for creating it? My company (http://www.statsmix.com) helps companies do this and we&#039;re always interested in how they start this process.</description>
