		<description>I am so mad and sad. After another fight over lack of money and long than we ever thought it would take, I just want to quit and go take a job coding for somebody else, so this stress ends. but i know i will be right back at it, persevering on our startup, because i&#039;m in a iteration loop that has no break. (that is a programming joke for you stupid non-techincal founders. what talent do you have anyway?)this story may help me through the night. if someone can be away from their lover for such a long time, than I can make it through another fight.</description>

		<description>Great post! Very interesting! The success definition of a project is based entirely on the efforts done by the employees. I believe that caring for your employees, giving them what&#039;s due them like workers compensation and pass atimmigration in Canada may encourage them to do their work more efficiently.</description>
