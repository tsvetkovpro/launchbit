<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that we&#8217;ll be releasing a book on email marketing in June! This is a book that we&#8217;ve been working on for a very long time based on data from across thousands of email lists.  (Even though the current cover says only my name, this book was written by my colleagues Audrey Cu, Zachary Tong, Jennifer Chin, and me.)</p>
<p>A few things about this book:</p>
<p><strong>1) This book is for data-driven marketers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6035" title="Data" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b-700x522.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" /></a></p>

<p>There is too much fluff in marketing. There are too many so-called experts who want to give you advice on marketing best practices that are not grounded in anything.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/publishing-book-on-email-marketing/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that we&#8217;ll be releasing a book on email marketing in June! This is a book that we&#8217;ve been working on for a very long time based on data from across thousands of email lists.  (Even though the current cover says only my name, this book was written by my colleagues Audrey Cu, Zachary Tong, Jennifer Chin, and me.)</p>
<p>A few things about this book:</p>
<p><strong>1) This book is for data-driven marketers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6035" title="Data" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b-700x522.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/notbrucelee/8016192302">justgrimes</a></em></p>
<p>There is too much fluff in marketing. There are too many so-called experts who want to give you advice on marketing best practices that are not grounded in anything. Our book is all about data. If you don&#8217;t enjoy looking at charts and graphs, this book is not for you.</p>
<p><strong>2) This book goes against the grain.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2546359596_d8445fd573_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6036" title="Grain" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2546359596_d8445fd573_b-700x451.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="361" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sidewalk_flying/2546359596/sizes/l">mykonos</a></em></p>
<p>Some of the advice that we&#8217;ll share in our book goes against common wisdom in marketing.  Our advice, again, is based on data. And we found that sometimes data suggests that you do something opposite to common wisdom. We don&#8217;t cater to the crowds, so if you want a book that discusses common marketing wisdom, this book is not for you.</p>
<p><strong>3) Our analyses are our own opinions.</strong></p>
<p>We are a very data-driven team. We look at numbers &#8211; a LOT.  In this book, to help you digest what the numbers mean, we&#8217;ll give you our interpretation of the data. That said, we will also be upfront with you about how strongly the data backs our opinion.  In some cases, we may not have enough data to conclusively argue for a particular case, and we&#8217;ll be frank with you about that.  We will try to lay out all the caveats we can think of since we aim to be as objective as possible. You will see both the data and our opinions and will be able to draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>4) This is not just some fluff marketing ebook.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7574100516_eca9106ed0_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6037" title="Fluffy clouds" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7574100516_eca9106ed0_b-700x393.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="314" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flynn_nrg/7574100516/">Miguel Mendez</a></em></p>
<p>We have spent 2 years building up to this book. And, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time writing, revising, and editing. Even though it&#8217;s being produced by a corporation, this is not some gimmick. This is a real book. <strong>And our aim is to make this the very best tactical, data-driven, marketing book you&#8217;ve read in a long time &#8212; it will be that good.  </strong>Even if you are a super experienced marketer and an email marketing expert, I think you will learn a lot from the data we&#8217;ve collected.  And certainly those who are new to email marketing will get a lot out of this book as well.</p>
<p><strong>5) Best of all, I am making this book free&#8230;but only for one week.</strong></p>
<p>The book isn&#8217;t done yet. Heck, the title is even a work in progress. But when it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m going to release it for free for one week. After that, we&#8217;ll charge for it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s going to be that good.  We&#8217;re giving everyone fair warning, so don&#8217;t come crawling to me in July asking me for a free copy of the book.  I don&#8217;t care how close we are &#8212; even my mom won&#8217;t get it for free after that one week.</p>
<p>So, make sure you don&#8217;t miss that free week.  Sign up below to get notified when we launch it. We are aiming to get this book done in the next month or so.</p>

<p>Beginning this week, customers of the Microsoft Advertising Exchange will have a clearer view into the inventory available in our marketplace. I want to share some thoughts on this exciting step forward. When Microsoft first launched our Ad Exchange, the RTB space was still relatively new. <a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/en-us/blogpost/129028/microsoft-advertising-blog/microsoft-improves-advertising-exchange-transparency">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5603" title="jump" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: personal-development-is-fun.com</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m here to tell you that headlines are THE MOST important element to split test</strong>, and thus, that is where you should start. The headline is the most important thing that you can split test because it is<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/"> the first “gateway”</a> that your readers have to pass through. On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only <a href="http://mediacorpus.com/truth-8020-rule/">2 out of 10 will read the rest</a>. This means that you will lose more people at the headline than anywhere else on the page, so test the headline first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it’s the first thing that your visitors will read, the headline of your landing page offers the biggest opportunity for improvements in conversion rate. Make it compelling, because<a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html"> you only have 0-8 seconds</a> to make an impression on your visitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You still think headlines aren’t THAT important?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you heard the story about advertising legend David Ogilvy, who rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement <strong>104 times</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5623" title="Rolls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is someone who clearly understood the power of headlines, and how the headline literally determined whether his content would get read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here another example. Adam Mordecai of Upworthy (formerly The Onion) says that he writes<a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"> 25 headlines for every post</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5622" title="blue text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blue-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, writing a great headline doesn’t guarantee success, but the better your headline, the better your chances of getting your content read and your visitors taking action. The benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied with your offer on the rest of your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every marketer would love to see an increase in clicks or conversions and we know that headlines have a BIG impact in making this happen.  Still, many many many b2b marketers underestimate just how important headlines are and how they can make a difference in getting more eyes on your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are a big deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why, again?</strong> Because it’s the first thing people will see. Not the text copy, not the form, not even the call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-write-headlines/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5621" title="KISSmetrics text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KISSmetrics-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s the takeaway?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are the MOST important landing page element to split test because they are what compel visitors to click, or read, or share, or convert. So spend considerable time writing your headlines and split testing to improve them. Many marketers spend A LOT of time testing various elements of their landing pages (<em>button colors are overrated</em>), but then just put any old headline at the top without realizing that in doing so they might not be ensuring that they are actually persuading their visitors to convert.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This scenario happens quite often and leaves a lot of b2b marketers with a decision to make. To split test or not to split test. We all know what split testing is and that it can surely improve landing page results if it’s done correctly, but how many of us have actually tried it and received results we could take action with? I’m guessing not many. Even if you&#8217;ve been thinking about split testing for a while, you might be wondering just exactly how much time you should spend on it?</p>
<p>The answer really depends on the size of your company – how many employees you have to put time into it, how much you have to pay for it, and how much traffic you receive to your landing page on a monthly basis. The more of these things you have, the more practical split testing will be. The less of these things, the less time and energy you should put into testing. Let’s expand on the most important of these things &#8211; traffic. You first need to make sure you have enough visitors going to your landing pages that will give you significant results during your split tests.</p>
<p><strong>So how many visitors are enough?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To get good numbers in your split testing efforts that will actually have an impact on your conversion rates, you should have a minimum of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=brand&amp;utm_campaign=G_WW_Search_Brand">100 visitors to each landing page and at least 20 conversions</a>. This means you need enough visitors to increase your conversion rate. This also means you need enough conversions to generate good results. Without this kind of volume, your split testing will not be worth it. That’s the simple truth.  As you grow your traffic and increase your leads you can decide when the return is worth investing more of your time split testing.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/split-test-calculator/">split test calculator</a>, a sort of cheat sheet, for you to try out. You can approximate traffic and conversion rates and see the results. It will help you decide if split testing is worthwhile.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve worked really hard to build your email list of potential customers and rabid fans of your business. Maybe you&#8217;ve even poured a lot of money into this to entice people to sign up for your list. Unfortunately, open rate declines are natural for email newsletters and email drip campaigns.</p>
<p>What?? My open rate has remained constant at 15%! How can this be?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve analyzed TONS of emails from various companies overtime, and even the best email marketers or the most interesting email newsletter publishers have declining open rates. Here&#8217;s a plot of the email marketing of one company we worked with. Although their overall open rate has managed to stay steady and consistent overall, if you plot out their open rate by cohort &#8212; when subscribers join their list &#8212; you can see that each cohort has a decline.</p>
<p>For example, the people who joined their list in Sept 2012 had a ~50% open rate at first and by 2013, this was down to &lt; 15% open rate. Same story for the people who joined in October 2012. Now, if you were to look at their overall open rate, this behavior would&#8217;ve been masked by the fact that they had a lot of people constantly joining the list and starting out at high open rates. So those people were opening, hiding the fact that people who had been on the list longer were not.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ImjCUDO4coor57CD-6ivyjDGX2myNz0ECltF3BNlccLT8yoSUUd1GgfP98UTeS9rnK8ZtM3xNJm75Q0tie1v6qqkLsb3OyIKe5fFVmgPJq2wqOBiUFv_ZKevlNU" alt="" width="NaN" height="NaN" /></p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s actually somewhat deceptive to look at your overall open rate. You don&#8217;t have a sense of which particular subgroups within your list are opening. Are they the same people? Different people? You don&#8217;t know whether your opens are getting better or worse with people who are still engaged.</p>
<p>That said, in reality, it&#8217;s difficult to plot out cohorts like the one above, and looking at your overall open rate is probably a better piece of data than none. But, when you do look at your open rate, just keep in mind that it&#8217;s not an accurate representation of what is happening amongst different groups of people on your email list.</p>

<p>By Elizabeth</p>
<p>This past week I was in San Francisco meeting with some folks from the Constant Contact office just to talk about email marketing. One of the topics we discussed was how small business owners can more effectively grow their email lists. This is an area that is near and dear to my heart, because we constantly hear from the thousands of email publishers we work with that it is freakin&#8217; hard to grow an email list. And yet, email lists are the stepping stone to acquiring new customers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve noticed at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> that there are a few different distinct stages of growth that email lists go through. For simplicity, we&#8217;ll talk about two of them.</p>
<p><strong>Going from 0 to 1000 subscribers</strong></p>
<p>This is the HARDEST stage of growth. And, this is where we see most email newsletter publishers stumble. People try to recruit friends and family to join their lists, but this only gets them so far&#8230; So as a result, a lot of the email publishers we work with are stuck with small lists.  Here are 3 ways to outgrow 1000 subscribers:</p>
<p><strong>1) Offer incentives</strong></p>
<p>Incentives work well! It could be a coupon for your store. It could be a contest freebie. It could be anything, but incentives work like crazy. Once you get beyond 1000 subscribers, you may want to throttle the incentives you dish out, but in the beginning, you don&#8217;t have many growth levers, so incentives are a good bet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2061/2102396938_83992de041_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/drh/2102396938/sizes/z/in/photolist-4cMkn5-4efwDT-4jCiyn-4jYTYK-4xFUAK-5Y7Uk1-5Yy3Fr-5Zr5y2-68oTXd-c3wPgy-cVrhqf-bn5uJv-9NRaEn-9AimQu-edcQ6Q-7PPfks-9ktx6r-86oERP-edcQ71-gxkWsN-aAECdR-btuZbF-aK7GSv-8N3r5m-gmPzzA-hdi8TN-9kwxxL-dyAY9r-fracVN-9DGhyr-agwXbq-fiyap5-9ZVcW9-dYa7We-agugUt-agufZp-9Dj3Av-fjxpx9-gY5WjT-aPWien-amE5yi-amDZVR-e7xNek-gdqiYv-fFtLAL-amGpKe-amJX5d-amE77i-amK7xs-amG7ta-fBBuMx/">Mandy_Jensen</a></em></p>
<p>If you offer a freebie, the biggest risk is that people who sign up for your list may not actually be interested in you or your product. They may just want the freebie. So be careful to align your freebie to your product or service as closely as you can.</p>
<p><strong>2) Make it really easy to sign up for your list.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-08-at-5.28.36-PM.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Screen Shot 2013-11-08 at 5.28.36 PM" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-08-at-5.28.36-PM.png" alt="" width="613" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>You know those pop-ups on blogs that ask you to sign up for their newsletter? (We have one.) Well, news flash: they really work. All too often, smaller newsletters just put a &#8220;Sign up here&#8221; link or input box off to the side of their blog or somewhere else hidden on their respective sites. If you have a small list and want more subscribers, you need to make sure everyone knows that they can sign up for your newsletter! Placement is everything.</p>
<p><strong>3) Use paid traffic to drive subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of ad networks you can use to get email subscribers. (I&#8217;m, of course, biased to my own ad network <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> &#8212; we can help you drive traffic to a landing page dedicated to helping you get subscribers.) What is important to note here is that a) if paying for traffic to get subscribers isn&#8217;t profitable for you, you&#8217;re doing this just to get past the 1000 subscriber mark &#8212; not doing this forever and b) you should only do this if you&#8217;re willing to create dedicated landing pages asking people to sign up for your list. You cannot just send people to cluttered home pages of your products or services.</p>
<p>Again, at this stage, you don&#8217;t have many levers to grow your list, so you&#8217;ll just need to hustle to get past the 1000 subscriber mark.</p>
<p><strong>Going from 1000 to 100,000 subscribers</strong></p>
<p>Once you get past 1000 subscribers, congrats! That&#8217;s quite an accomplishment. You now have a lot more options you can use to grow your list, and you should achieve much faster growth now. Here are 2 ways to grow your list to the 100k subscriber mark.</p>
<p><strong>1) Do cross-promotions with other email newsletter publishers</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re at a certain size, other email newsletter publishers will want to do co-marketing with you, and this can be very effective and cost-effective. For example, with one of our lists, we did a cross-promotion with another company that had &lt; 30k subscribers and a 30% open rate. They ran a blurb about our list and encouraged people to sign up, and likewise, we ran a blurb for them encouraging our subscribers to sign up for their list. With this one-time cross-promotion, the other company placed a blurb about our list only in the middle of their email newsletter, so I honestly didn&#8217;t expect too many people to even read far down enough to read the promotion about us. Nonetheless, enough people did, and we were able to get about 100 new free subscribers from that one promotion.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the typical math you should be doing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Partner company&#8217;s list size * their open rate * [x% click-through-rate] * [y% landing page conversion rate] = # of new sign ups</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For x%, if the other company is going to give you a nice shoutout in text at the top of their newsletter, you can probably easily drive 1%-10% click-through-rate. If the company isn&#8217;t going to mention you until the middle or bottom of their list, maybe you&#8217;re looking at around 0.1-0.7% click-through-rate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Y% conversion rate is the rate at which new subscribers convert on your blog or landing page. So if you have a nice layout with a strong call-to-action, you can probably get a signup rate of 20-40%. Meaning of 100 people who click through to your sign up page, 20-40 people end up signing up for your newsletter. If your landing page is cluttered, then it will be much less.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the case of the cross promotion that we did with the company I mentioned above, I was expecting:<br />
30k subscriber base * 30% open rate * roughly 0.3% click-through-rate * 20% conversion rate on our landing page = ~50 signups</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, getting 100 signups was double my expectation and great!</p>
<p>Obviously, you need to have compelling reasons for why your subscribers should sign up for someone else&#8217;s list &#8212; e.g. Awesome product, free credit for something, great offer, compelling/funny content, etc. But, if you have a good reason, cross-promotions can work out really well.</p>
<p>Hint: the best email companies &#8212; you know the ones with millions of subscribers &#8212; do cross-promotions like this all-day everyday. They have whole teams who focus on getting growth in this manner. Need help finding and reaching out to other newsletters? We built <a href="http://www.newsletterdirectory.co">newsletterdirectory.co</a> for this purpose &#8212; to help email publishers find others like them.</p>
<p>Now, chances are you, you won&#8217;t find newsletter publishers who are exactly your size. That&#8217;s ok. Your negotiating lever is the placement of the shoutout. For example, if your list is smaller than a potential cross promotion partner, then you can offer to place a shoutout for them towards the top of your newsletter, and they can move a shoutout for you down. And vice versa.  Make sure you understand what your cross promotion partner&#8217;s open rate is like.  Just because someone has a large-sounding list doesn&#8217;t mean anything if no one is opening their emails!</p>
<p><strong>2) Use social proof</strong></p>
<p>Once you get thousands of subscribers, it&#8217;s an impressive feat. You should brag about it. Subscribers beget subscribers. I am more likely to sign up for your list if I know that you have thousands of subscribers. So, in all of your copy, you should ask people to join the thousands of other subscribers by signing up for your list.</p>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s HARD to get past 1000 subscribers. But, once you do, your list growth should accelerate with the latter two methods.</p>
<p>How do you grow your list(s)?</p>

<p>Happy fall! With all the holidays ahead, you can bet that it&#8217;s going to be yet another crowded email season. Discounts for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and all the sales and specials in between. A number of businesses rely on this season for a significant portion of their revenue.</p>
<p>And so you might think that this is the right time to get your email marketing ideas in gear for the holidays. Errr. Unfortunately, December is the WORST time to do email marketing. With competition from all businesses, consumers will be overloaded with emails, and spam filters will be stricter than ever.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/the-email-marketing-season-is-upon-us/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>Happy fall! With all the holidays ahead, you can bet that it&#8217;s going to be yet another crowded email season. Discounts for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and all the sales and specials in between. A number of businesses rely on this season for a significant portion of their revenue.</p>
<p>And so you might think that this is the right time to get your email marketing ideas in gear for the holidays. Errr. Unfortunately, December is the WORST time to do email marketing. With competition from all businesses, consumers will be overloaded with emails, and spam filters will be stricter than ever. Even if you aren&#8217;t a spammer, your emails are more likely to go to spam at this time of the year.</p>
<p>So what should you do?</p>
<p><strong>1) Send when other businesses are not sending.</strong></p>
<p>To have a better shot at getting attention and into inboxes, you should send at non-peak times around this holiday season. This is before Black Friday and after the New Year. If you can tie your product or service or newsletter to a promotion such as a &#8220;Beat the holiday&#8221; coupon or a &#8220;New Year&#8217;s special,&#8221; that&#8217;s most ideal.</p>
<p><strong>2) Upgrade to a dedicated IP address.</strong></p>
<p>If you share an IP address, your reputation (and ability to get into inboxes) is <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/what-can-a-dedicated-ip-address-do-for-my-email-marketing/">tied to all the other email marketers on the same IP address</a>. Unfortunately, during the holiday season, email marketers can sometimes go a little crazy and undertake spammier behavior. By upgrading to your own IP address, you can avoid being tied to other email marketers&#8217; behaviors and increase your chances of getting into inboxes.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 19px;">The Rise</span></strong></p>
<p>Native ads are all the rage these days, seamlessly blending engaging content into the property&#8217;s environment. But to really understand why, we need to take a look at the history of online advertising.  In the 90s, when the dot com boom was starting to take off, I was just entering high school in the Silicon Valley and I had the opportunity to briefly help (if you can call it that) at a banner ad company.  They were rocking it, seeing very high click-through-rates (CTR) and charging just pennies per click.  Back then, everyone and their mother was clicking, so even at just pennies, this company was rolling in the dough.  They later sold for hundreds of millions of dollars before the dot com bust in the early 2000s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rise1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4421" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="rise" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rise1-250x218.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="109" /></a> But they weren&#8217;t the only ones raking it in.  <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/05/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/">Just about every banner ad company was doing the same</a>.  Banner ads were seeing anywhere between 50-90% CTR!  It was an insane time!  As a result, the effective CPMs were also very high. For example, let’s say you ran a website with a 70% CTR on one banner ad and only made $0.05 per click. For every 1000 visitors, you were still making 1000 * 70% * $0.05 = $35 eCPMs!</p>
<h2>The Fall</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fall1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4422" title="fall" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fall1-250x173.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="86" /></a>Fast forward to today.  The CTR on banner ads has plummeted to about 0.1%.  So your eCPM is now 5 cents instead of $35! Advertisers are getting way fewer clicks and publishers are hardly making any money at all.  Why?  Consumers have <a href=" http://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">banner-blindness</a>.   Banner ads are now standardized, so they look the same on every single site.  It makes it easy to ignore ads even if they are relevant and well-targeted.</p>
<h2>The Resurrection</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/resurrection1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4423" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-right: 15px;" title="resurrection" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/resurrection1.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="191" /></a>We see banner-blindness in our own network since we offer both banner and text ads.  The latter looks native to the look and feel of a given newsletter, while the former is a traditional banner ad format.  In our controlled studies, time and again, the text ads will always win doing 2-10x greater CTR than banner ads.  Think about it &#8212; an order of magnitude difference in CTR is an order of magnitude difference in revenue.  In other words, instead of making $10 with banner ads, you could be making $100.  At first, this difference astounded me, but now it seems obvious.  Native ads have high CTRs for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p><span>1) They look like they fit the content.  Since users are actively reading the content, they are more likely to read the ad.  </span></p>
<p><span>2) The look-and-feel required to be a native ad will differ from property to property, so users are not able to learn to ignore ads.</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<h2>The Epiphany</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/epiphany1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4424" title="epiphany" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/epiphany1.jpg" alt="" width="82" height="248" /></a>Advertisers get more engagement with native ads compared to banner ads on an eCPM basis. If you are a publisher and can choose your ad format, it’s a no-brainer to run native ads.  Since they are more effective, advertisers should also be willing to pay more for these on an eCPM basis.  Everyday, we hear about online newspaper companies struggling, because banner ads are just not paying them enough to make their business model work.  By adopting native ads, media companies should be able to increase their revenue by an order of magnitude, and advertisers will pay for this, because it works better than banner ads.</p>
<p>Get ready for a new world. There&#8217;s a new way to get customers now, and everyone &#8212; marketers, agencies, ad exchanges and networks &#8212; will need to be prepared for this big change.  Have questions or thoughts about what this new world will look like?  Type them below.</p>
