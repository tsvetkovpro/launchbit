<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/azugaldia/8227841308/in/photolist-dx4QyU-8R8gts-brysve-6rpnNr-d1f3xj-brysSk-bryAjr-brysPv-brysLF-brysH8-6DT2Az-dCJEjp-7Xq7w2-jRNyA5-6FJECn-7jVpZw-daHcYj-daHbHy">Antonio Zugaldia</a></em></p>
<p>When SaaS was new about a decade ago, a lot of companies added a free plan. At the time, having a free plan was a nearly free marketing strategy, because it attracted product signups. These days, however, free SaaS plans are no longer unique. And in fact, for many SMB-focused SaaS companies, a free plan may not even make economical sense.</p>
<p>So, with the combination of free plans becoming harder to market and the rise in SaaS companies addressing the SMB market, I was curious if freemium was still popular amongst SaaS companies?</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be impossible to analyze every single SaaS company. So to get a snapshot of the SaaS landscape, I decided to take a look at companies in the SaaS marketplace <a href="http://www.getapp.com/">GetApp</a>. I took a look at a handful of categories: Business Intelligence Software, Customer Management Software, Marketing Software, and Sales Software. Specifically, I looked at the first page of featured companies in these categories.</p>
<p>I found 3 interesting insights:</p>
<p><strong>1) Most SaaS companies (in this dataset) are not freemium!</strong></p>
<p>Given all the talk about free plans in SaaS, I was surprised that most of the SaaS companies I looked at did *not* have a free plan. However, as recently as last month, the Harvard Business Review called freemium the &#8220;<a href="http://hbr.org/2014/05/making-freemium-work/ar/1">dominant business model</a>&#8220;.  But, this just isn&#8217;t as true as people think.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.18.47-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6174" title="Business Intelligence Freemium breakdown" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.18.47-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Business Intelligence category had the lowest percentage of SaaS companies that had free plans &#8211; a mere 12% of companies in this category offered a free plan. The Sales and Marketing categories were just slightly higher at 16% and 20% freemium respectively.</p>
<p><strong>2) The Customer Management category is the exception.</strong></p>
<p>However, the customer management category has a lot more SaaS companies with free plans. A whopping 32% of companies in this category were freemium. You could speculate why this might be. Salesforce is the behemoth in this category. The other categories don&#8217;t have a dominant player with the same level of legacy and revenue that Salesforce has. It&#8217;s possible that other companies in this category may be trying to use free to gain some ground on Goliath.</p>
<p><strong>3) &#8220;Near free&#8221; may be the new freemium.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.19.51-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6175" title="Customer Management Software freemium breakdown" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.19.51-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Customer Management category also has a couple of companies that have a &#8220;near free&#8221; package. Namely, you pay just $1 per agent per month. $1?? That&#8217;s super cheap &#8212; that&#8217;s just about free. Yet, it requires you to input your credit card in order to use this package, making it easier for these companies to upsell you later.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: It&#8217;s unclear how GetApp chose to feature companies for each category.  Interestingly, a lot of well known companies or rising startups were notably missing from all of these categories.  In addition, many of the categories had companies that provided a couple of different offerings.  Zoho, for example, has a number of products, and all of their products are free.  So, including multiple products from the same company skews the results as well.</p>
<p>Shortcomings of the data aside, this is a good snapshot of how a number of  SaaS companies may be thinking about freemium.  Marketers may be finding freemium to no longer be a good business strategy.  Does this surprise you?</p>

<p>Ever notice that when you post to your Facebook page, your posts don&#8217;t reach most of your Facebook followers (people who have Liked your Facebook page)? How does Facebook decide who to show your Facebook posts to? We&#8217;ve been trying to reverse-engineer this algorithm.</p>

<p>Ever notice that when you post to your Facebook page, your posts don&#8217;t reach most of your Facebook followers (people who have Liked your Facebook page)? How does Facebook decide who to show your Facebook posts to? We&#8217;ve been trying to reverse-engineer this algorithm.</p>
<p>In our last post, we showed that there actually are <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/ideal-time-post-facebook/">ideal times to post to Facebook</a> (at least for us at LaunchBit).  In today&#8217;s post, we&#8217;ll analyze whether there&#8217;s an ideal day of the week to post to Facebook. Note: this again is using our data at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>First, I plotted the reach that each of our posts achieved against day of the week. (n=180 posts)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/impression_by_week.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6153" title="Impression Reach by Day of the Week" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/impression_by_week-700x272.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Then I took the average reach of each day as well as the overall average (mean) of the whole dataset.  I did this excluding the two outliers (outlined in pink above).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-9.36.40-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6157" title="Average impression reach by day of the week" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-9.36.40-AM.png" alt="" /></a>The overall mean for the total dataset (excluding the 2 outliers) is 35.6.  The dataset also does not have a normal distribution.  (Normal as in the statistics definition of the word)  The standard deviation for the whole dataset is 28.5.  If it were normal, it would mean that almost every post would reach between -50 and  121.1.  But, reaching a negative number of people is just not possible on Facebook. <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, just from eyeballing these numbers, you can see that no particular day of the week garners greater reach than others.  The average reach for each day of the week is within 3 impressions from the overall mean.</p>
<p>In plain English, <strong>it does not matter what day of the week we post</strong>.  Have you found that certain days have greater reach than others for your Facebook page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook is a black box to marketers.  If you post to your company page, your post often won&#8217;t be shown to everyone who has Liked it.  At <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, we currently have 264 Likes on our company page.  But, when we post to our page, you can see that most of the time, not even half of our audience sees our posts.</p>
<p>A lot of marketers claim there&#8217;s an ideal time to post to Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Contact </strong><a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/product-blogs/social-media-marketing/best-time-post-facebook/">suggests that 6:30-8:30am</a> (unclear of the timezone) is optimal for them, because people see their posts when they wake up and check their phones.</li>

<p>Facebook is a black box to marketers.  If you post to your company page, your post often won&#8217;t be shown to everyone who has Liked it.  At <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, we currently have 264 Likes on our company page.  But, when we post to our page, you can see that most of the time, not even half of our audience sees our posts.</p>
<p>A lot of marketers claim there&#8217;s an ideal time to post to Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Contact </strong><a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/product-blogs/social-media-marketing/best-time-post-facebook/">suggests that 6:30-8:30am</a> (unclear of the timezone) is optimal for them, because people see their posts when they wake up and check their phones.</li>
<li><strong>AddThis </strong><a href="http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/04/03/whens-the-best-day-and-time-to-post-on-social-media/">recommends Thursdays 9am-12noon ET</a> are optimal clicks and shares.</li>
<li><strong>MediaBistro </strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/social-best-times-post_b49546">shares between 6-8am and 2-5pm</a> (unclear of the timezone).</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the right time differs for everyone.  So we decided to analyze our own data.  (n=189)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-05-at-12.57.08-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6133" title="LaunchBit reach by time" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-05-at-12.57.08-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Here are our 189 posts over the last couple of years plotted by time and reach.  On first glance, the data appears to be all over the place.  (Note: the definition of &#8220;reach&#8221; is the unique number of people who see a given post on Facebook.)</p>
<p>But, with a more in-depth look, there are a couple of interesting findings:</p>
<p><strong>1) Our top posts were posted between 1-4pm PT</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Top_quartile_posts1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6136" title="Top Quartile Posts" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Top_quartile_posts1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I took the top quartile of posts with the greatest reach and categorized them by time.  This is represented by the blue bars.  For example, you can see that 11 of my posts with the greatest reach were posted between 3-4pm.</p>
<p>Then I graphed how many posts you would expect to be in the top quartile for each duration of time if time were not a factor in Facebook&#8217;s reach algorithm.  This is shown by the red bars.  Here&#8217;s the interesting part: where the blue bars are significantly higher than red bars indicates where time has helped our posts get more reach.  In this case, the top posts tended to be between 1-4pm PT.</p>
<p><strong>2) The bottom quartile of posts were posted between 8-9am and 4-5pm</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bottom_quartile_posts.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6137" title="Bottom quartile posts" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bottom_quartile_posts.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I used a similar approach with the bottom quartile of posts.  I categorized the posts with the worst reach by time, and this is represented by the blue bars.  For example, 12 posts in this quartile were posted between 8-9am.  The red bars represent the number of posts you&#8217;d expect in each time bucket if time were not a factor in determining reach.  So, where the blue bars significantly are higher than the red bars are the worst times to post.  In this case, between 8-9am and 4-5pm were the worst time periods to post.</p>
<p>The takeaways here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our best time to post is between 1-4pm PT.</li>
<li>Our worst time(s) to post are 8-9am PT and 4-5pm PT.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t know anything about posting between 7pm-7am, since we&#8217;ve never done this before.</li>
<li>Your data may show something different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, we should always try to post between 1-4pm to give ourselves the best shot at maximum reach.</p>
<p>Do you know when is the best time for you to post to your Facebook page?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I last wrote about whether doing <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads/">lead generation on a small blog</a> is worth the effort.  Surprisingly, I found that it&#8217;s not a bad investment of time, because you do the work once, and then you reap the benefits there on out. When I published this post, someone on <a href="http://quibb.com/links/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads">Quibb</a>, asked me how our blog efforts compare to all our other content marketing efforts in generating leads.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I last wrote about whether doing <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads/">lead generation on a small blog</a> is worth the effort.  Surprisingly, I found that it&#8217;s not a bad investment of time, because you do the work once, and then you reap the benefits there on out. When I published this post, someone on <a href="http://quibb.com/links/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads">Quibb</a>, asked me how our blog efforts compare to all our other content marketing efforts in generating leads.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our content marketing activities at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> and how they compare against each other. (Note: Our content marketing pales in comparison to efforts of much larger software companies, so this is by no means what is considered optimal &#8212; it&#8217;s just how we do things at LaunchBit)</p>
<p><strong>Webinars: 100-600 leads per webinar</strong></p>

<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stephanridgway/3832520295/in/photolist-a8EeJJ-6mpuuw-7oytoK-89aCbc-8d8SVE-7GYU48-8d5A7e-nECjA5-cU8j1w-8d5A56-8SyvYL-8d5zXr-8d8SNb-8WrAT2-ihhmYc-8Syvwm-8ZBkDP-6bGNvP-8F43o2-5eL9xD-eWvyRD-eWGT5u-eWGNP1-6TUsNY-6XSo4f-e1jSdB-7gF2dM-5Kjbfk-63VDX1-duGXfb-8NBot4-396ZPh-9J3kbX-kGXxpq-7Rf6mY-7ReSWC-kGHbjX-34MSBK-7Rf6n1-5GeZNH-6QEEL8-6wrNMW-bxp9sJ-ekAeVq-5GeZJP-arEyMP-7N85or-aPa8rn-aPa8pK-4tFUSW">Stephan Ridgway</a></em></p>
<p>Webinars are by far one of our best content marketing activities.  Typically, we&#8217;ll partner with a complementary company, create slides together, and share the webinar time.  Both parties will promote the webinar through email marketing, encouraging people to sign up, and these leads are shared between the two companies.  As such, we don&#8217;t partner with companies that have aggressive email marketing.  We make sure that we have a solid fit with a company before deciding to partner with them.</p>
<p>Webinars are a lot of work, though. Putting together slides, coordinating meetings to decide content and rehearse, and finally doing post-production on a video all takes time &#8211; probably about 20-30 hours in total.  We are not currently doing lead generation on the webinar videos we generate, so this activity currently does not yield subsequent lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>Blog: 100 leads per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6103" title="Blog" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z-640x426.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="http://www.manoftaste.de/" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="25">www.manoftaste.de</a></em></p>
<p>We mentioned in our last post that we are currently generating about 30 leads per month (roughly 100 leads per quarter) on our blog.  We have blogged as often as 4x per week but currently blog 1-2x per week.  Each blog post takes approximately 2-4 hours to write and edit.  If we blog once a week for a whole quarter and can drive approximately 100 leads, then blogging starts to rival a webinar.  Unlike webinars which just generate one tranche of leads, blogging can potentially lead to greater, continuous lead generation if we can continue to increase traffic to our blog.</p>
<p><strong>eBooks: a handful per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6105" title="ebooks" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Our eBooks, in general, don&#8217;t yield a lot of organic leads.  <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/improve-the-roi-of-your-content-marketing-recap/">Paid marketing works well for eBook signups</a>, especially through LaunchBit&#8217;s integrations with publisher partners.  But, as far as free leads go, we only get a handful in a given quarter.  In part, our eBooks also tend to be hidden on their own special landing pages that are disconnected from our website.  eBooks also take a lot of time to put together.  They can take 2-4 weeks of calendar time and about 80 hours of work, including design, writing, editing, and formatting.  That said, because eBooks are great for generating paid leads, they are worthwhile if you are running paid campaigns (and we are).</p>
<p><strong>Books: unknown</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6106" title="books" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/61423903@N06/7357608430/in/photolist-cdaEDL-7gc2rv-5t7uJJ-icWej8-51mJzS-jEaUkN-7yy8k8-72Lhev-4fNJ8u-dksMMw-gFA2zs-4S3Rz-dXDrCi-bbCsgV-PZmWU-dphnAE-Zaprp-9t3w-4ceX98-MVmkH-a9R8Ca-7m5SbQ-fppyGr-cEHvLj-7xMoXo-4tqvEc-5BTZjt-33MFv8-kJYLhg-t6cAk-5oK63e-9qJTTP-815VLA-PGhq-4cr2hy-fsYVnU-6q6CnC-6Uccv-7uJEYD-e8DYeU-61T8sa-4nkMU2-d5CHJ5-72DYa6-3HcK46-cFssXu-8DCUdi-72UGw5-j6pg8a-7tZvJ2">FutUndBeitl</a></em></p>
<p>Lastly, we are currently writing a &#8220;regular book&#8221; on email marketing. Unlike an eBook, regular books tend to be higher quality, and in fact, we&#8217;re going to be selling our book on Amazon.  The email marketing book we&#8217;re writing has taken a couple years of calendar time and about 300-400 hours of design, copywriting, and editing&#8230;and still counting.  We are not sure whether this activity is worthwhile for lead generation, but we have decided to give this a shot, because we had enough content to write a solid book.  We hope you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a great book, too!</p>
<p>In short, webinars are currently the best organic lead generation activity for us, but based on the trajectory of our blog traffic, we expect our blog lead generation to overtake webinars in the next few months and show greater ROI for our content creation time.</p>
<p>What are the most effective pieces of content for your lead generation?</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I read a great post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2014/03/11/get-first-100-email-subscribers/">How to get your first 100 email subscribers</a> by Bryan Harris for <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan&#8217;s blog</a>. The author placed leadboxes around his blog and shared where he was able to get the most email signups for his email newsletter.</p>
<p>We were curious and decided to conduct a similar experiment for the last month (5/5-5/26). In fact, we straight up copied some of his ideas. In particular, what we wanted to know was whether these lead generation ideas would help us even though we have a small blog.  We get between 1000-6000 blog visitors a month.  Here are our results:</p>
<p><strong>1) Byline leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We replicated this idea directly from Bryan.  For every post, we wrote a &#8220;byline&#8221; telling people to &#8220;Get updates of new posts here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6055" title="Byline lead generation" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png" alt="" width="465" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>When someone clicks the byline a leadbox pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6056" title="Byline lead generation popup" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png" alt="" width="447" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Bryan talks about a 0.6% conversion rate with this lead capture method on his blog, but it&#8217;s unclear to me whether this is a conversion percentage based on total impressions of the byline link or of the popup.  Regardless, for us, we had a 0% conversion rate &#8211; no one signed up!</p>
<p>That said, the click-through-rate on the byline link was quite low at 0.09%.   So, split testing this method would not be worthwhile for us.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Post-footer leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also placed a leadbox below each blog post encouraging people to sign up for our email newsletter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6057" title="Footer leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png" alt="" width="468" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>The results on this leadbox were fairly poor.  In May, seven people subscribed to our newsletter via this box.  There were across 4183 non-unique impressions of this footer box in May.  This method of lead generation probably isn&#8217;t worth optimizing, because even if we 10x-ed our results, the conversion rate would still be low.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.2% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Sidebar leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox on the upper right side of our blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6058" title="Sidebar leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM-700x291.png" alt="" width="490" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>The byline and footer leadboxes were fairly hidden, so to be honest, I didn&#8217;t expect them to do very well.  But, I did expect this sidebar lead generation box to perform a lot better.  However, we saw just 1 conversion!  The results were even worse than the footer leadbox.</p>
<p>Bryan uses a sidebar leadbox that scrolls as a reader is reading a post and achieved an 0.8% conversion rate on his blog.  If we were to modify this sidebar leadbox, we would likely try a similar strategy with a auto-scrolling box.  I speculate that perhaps our blog visitors are not interested in signing up to read more posts until they&#8217;ve actually read one first, so an auto-scrolling box might help with conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.02% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Header leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox at the top of our blog.  This header leadbox, however, did/does not show up at the top of specific blog posts.  It only shows up on our blog synopsis page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6060" title="Header leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM-700x293.png" alt="" width="490" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the ideal placement (you cannot possibly miss this!), I&#8217;d expected this leadbox to do quite well.  However, this leadbox received 0 signups!</p>
<p>Like the sidebar widget, perhaps, if this header appeared after someone read one of our posts, then it might perform better. A future experiment might be to show this header leadbox on specific blog posts and scroll as a reader reads a post.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) Timed pop-up leadbox</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we implemented the <a href="http://sumome.com/">SumoMe</a> leadbox for our blog.  This leadbox pops up in the middle of the blog after a certain amount of time.  It shows up on any of our blog pages.  Compared to all the other leadboxes we&#8217;ve tried, this popup performed the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.46.44-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6061" title="Popup leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.46.44-PM.png" alt="" width="413" height="358" /></a></p>
<p>Bryan was able to get a 5%+ conversion rate on his blog.  Although our conversion rate was not nearly as high, these results are definitely at a good point to start tweaking.  In less than one month, we were able to get 19 new email signups from this one tactic.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.7% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p>Although a total of 27 new leads across all five tactics is not a lot, if we leave them up for the next 2 months, we&#8217;ll be able to hit 100 new subscribers from organic traffic for just a couple of hours of work that it took to place these leadboxes on our site.  With some tweaking of the leadboxes, we might be able to get some multiple on email signups as well.  And obviously if we can grow our blog, that will lead to a multiple in signups as well.</p>
<p>I was initially skeptical that a small blog like ours could get a significant number of leads from these different tactics.  And while a larger blog could achieve so many more leads for the same amount of work, the results haven&#8217;t been bad for us.  A lot of B2B companies value email signups at $5-$30 per lead, and we&#8217;re no different.  For a small blog like ours, we now see that a couple hours of work leads to recurring $100-1000 in new value per month.  Trying these leadbox tactics has been worthwhile, and I would recommend giving some of these ideas a whirl on your own blog for your own email marketing program.</p>
<p>What leadboxes do you use on your site?</p>

<p><em>image courtesy of <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/capture-user-interest-with-the-lead-generation-card">Twitter</a></em></p>
<p>Twitter cards are essentially apps that run within <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. One type of card that is particularly interesting to marketers is the Twitter Lead Generation card. We&#8217;ve previously written about <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-use-twitter-cards-for-b2b-lead-generation-3/">how to set it up</a>, but what can you do with it? How do you use it to encourage people to sign up for your email mailing list? 3 clever ideas we&#8217;ve seen:</p>
<p><strong>1) Thank</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them. Ryan realized this was an opportunity to encourage people to sign up for his mailing list so that he could continue to reach these people with subsequent posts that might be useful to them.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/3-hacks-generate-leads-twitter-cards/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>Twitter cards are essentially apps that run within <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. One type of card that is particularly interesting to marketers is the Twitter Lead Generation card. We&#8217;ve previously written about <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-use-twitter-cards-for-b2b-lead-generation-3/">how to set it up</a>, but what can you do with it? How do you use it to encourage people to sign up for your email mailing list? 3 clever ideas we&#8217;ve seen:</p>
<p><strong>1) Thank</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them. Ryan realized this was an opportunity to encourage people to sign up for his mailing list so that he could continue to reach these people with subsequent posts that might be useful to them.</p>
<p>So, he created a Twitter Lead Generation card for his mailing list, and each time he thanked people on Twitter, he encouraged them to also sign up for his mailing list.</p>

<p><em>image courtesy of <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/67662891557/grow-your-email-list-with-this-simple-twitter-hack">Ryan Hoover</a></em></p>
<p>The neat thing about this approach was that with one-click, people could easily sign up to receive subsequent posts, and he was engaging with an audience that wanted to hear from him.  <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/67662891557/grow-your-email-list-with-this-simple-twitter-hack">Read his full post on this here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Run a contest</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockcreek.com">Rock/Creek</a> uses Twitter Lead Generation Cards to increase signups for their mailing list. They generated 1700 leads in one week for a contest that would give away a new pair of sandals.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/lead-generation-card-now-available-to-all-advertisers-with-new-features">Read more about how they did this here &gt;&gt; </a></p>
<p><strong>3) Giveaways and freebies</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you can give freebies to people who sign up for your mailing list. We&#8217;ve seen everything from free icons/images/clip art for designers to free coffees to free content. A cautionary note: if you&#8217;re trying to maximize your ROI on your email signups, you probably want to give away something that is aligned with your business. Giving away a free coffee as a B2B business might not attract the most relevant leads. But, giving away designer files or templates if you&#8217;re aiming to reach designers would be a great offer.</p>
<p>How have you used Twitter Lead Generation Cards?  Has it been effective?</p>

<p>A lot of companies talk about how to build a data-driven company cultures.

<p>A lot of companies talk about how to build a data-driven company cultures. And while this is important (and something we explicitly wrote in our company values at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>), we found that we needed to get more specific and tactical for our marketing team.</p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong><br />
My co-founder Jennifer and I are very data-oriented people. In day-to-day conversations, we&#8217;ll build arguments with facts and experiments.  We both are engineers by training, and I even TA-ed and tutored basic statistics at MIT. Data is really important to us and something we naturally wanted to explicitly write into our company values. And we did.</p>
<p><strong>You must turn your philosophy on data into action</strong><br />
But, even if you&#8217;re data-driven in personality, it can be very easy to not carry-through in your team dynamics.</p>
<p>In 2011, when we first started LaunchBit, we would look at our numbers religiously. We would carefully keep track on spreadsheets our conversions for everything.  From conversion rates of investors (even down to the category of investor: gender, race!) to conversion rates of our customers, we would track it. But slowly over time, by 2012 and early 2013, we were getting sloppy. Especially on the customer acquisition front, which is what I own here at LaunchBit. We had so many experiments going on that we got to the point where we had too many spreadsheets floating around, and it was tough to keep track of everything! If you have too many dashboards and accounts to check, at some point, you stop checking them and forget all about them. After a year or so, it basically became one big bear.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="bear" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5488/10055709303_bc0c985ede_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="512" /></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tambako/10055709303/sizes/z/">tambako</a></em></p>
<p>So I stopped taking a look at all data. I feel sheepish in saying that I used to chastise people for not looking at their Google Analytics accounts or knowing their numbers. But, guess what &#8212; it&#8217;s very easy to not check when you have so many experiments going on and too much data to check.</p>
<p>So, we regrouped and realized we had a mess on our hands. We had too many experiments that were running, forgotten about, and we needed to end the ones that were not working. We needed a better way to structure experiments.</p>
<p><strong>How we structure experiments today</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Experiments" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8193079579_0684a7abb9_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mobilestreetlife/8193079579/sizes/z/">mobilestreetlife</a></em></p>
<p>We are now much more methodical about marketing experiments at LaunchBit. Here&#8217;s how we structure them.</p>
<p><em>1) We hold a standing product meeting each week to talk about our experiments.</em><br />
Everyone involved in customer acquisition is in this meeting plus head of product (Jennifer). We spend half the time discussing the status of existing experiments and the other half of the time developing new experiments. These experiments are generally small: in 1-2 week sprints.</p>
<p><em>2) We use Google Docs to keep a running list of experiments</em><br />
When we create a new experiment, we&#8217;ll come up with a structure and rough timeframe. For example, when <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-increase-traffic-to-your-blog-post-by-100-using-twitter/">we tested Twitter headlines</a>, we determined:</p>
<ul>
<li>What our hypothesis was &#8212; e.g. we&#8217;d be able to find a statistically significant headline</li>
<li>How many headlines we were going to test</li>
<li>On what schedule to tweet our headlines</li>
<li>What data we needed to see if our hypothesis was correct</li>
<li>How we would track and document data</li>
<li>What timeframe we would run the experiment for</li>
</ul>
<p>We would then set action items and respective owners for the week to make progress on this experiment.</p>
<p><em>3) We discuss experiments still in play on a weekly basis</em></p>
<p>Each week, for experiments that are near or past their expected timeframe, we determine whether to kill, continue, or expand the experiment &#8212; this is probably the most important part. All too often experiments are not very conclusive, so you need them to run longer than initially expected. This is where experiments often go to the land of the dead, because people lose track of them. We decided that we needed to take an active stance in monitoring experiments and actively decide an experiment&#8217;s status. If we decide to continue an experiment, it gets another timeframe added to it as if it&#8217;s a new experiment.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why experiments often end up in a limbo zone is that you rarely have breakout results either way.  Much like how you don&#8217;t want your company to be in the <a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/are-you-running-a-zombie-start-up.html">land of the walking dead</a>, you don&#8217;t want your marketing experiments to be here either. Having too many experiments build up in the zombie zone makes for unmanageable experimentation. So, eventually, all experiments must have a definitive end, and the only way to ensure this is to put strict timelines on experiments so that you can actively review.</p>
<p><strong>There is an opportunity cost to having too many experiments</strong></p>
<p>What is often unspoken is that there is an opportunity cost to having too many experiments. You have limited time to manage and actively tweak a certain number of experiments. By putting time constraints on experiments, you are forcing your existing experiments to compete against new experiment ideas you may have. Each time you want to extend the lifetime of an experiment, you are actively deciding against doing a new potential experiment, which means you believe that the current experiment has a better shot at &#8220;winning&#8221; than something else you could be trying.</p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to build a data-driven marketing team</strong></p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re a data-driven person, it can be difficult to build a data-driven team as you scale. One of the reasons our data-collection fell apart in the first place is that chaos started occurring as we started expanding our team and number of activities, etc. Chaos is natural in startups and fast-growing teams. And it&#8217;s the antithesis of structure, which is exactly what you need to be data-driven. You can still be speedy and data-driven with structure. But, to initially put that in place requires taking a step back and spending the time to put processes in place.  That requires taking a momentary pause, which causes a lot of people to cringe, but it&#8217;s worthwhile in the long-run.</p>
<p>How do you create a data-driven marketing team?</p>

<p>Facebook ads have gone through massive transitions over the years. In the beginning, the targeting capabilities were very simple: select demographic options and get your campaign in front of people who met those demographics. The problem with this was that you didn&#8217;t have the ability to go granular in your campaign. If you wanted to reach small business owners, they put your ad in front of EVERYONE who was even remotely involved with a small business. But what if you just wanted to reach say small business owners who were Constant Contact users? There wasn&#8217;t a way to get that granular.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/three-ways-to-reach-hyper-targeted-business-audiences-using-facebook/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.02-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5964" title="Hyper-targeted audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.02-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Facebook ads have gone through massive transitions over the years. In the beginning, the targeting capabilities were very simple: select demographic options and get your campaign in front of people who met those demographics. The problem with this was that you didn&#8217;t have the ability to go granular in your campaign. If you wanted to reach small business owners, they put your ad in front of EVERYONE who was even remotely involved with a small business. But what if you just wanted to reach say small business owners who were Constant Contact users? There wasn&#8217;t a way to get that granular.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook has an immense number of ad targeting options that most people don&#8217;t know about but are really powerful. Here are 3 ways to hyper-targeted business audiences on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>1) Retarget visitors to your site</strong></p>
<p>This is the most well-known of the three options. You can cookie visitors to your site and then display ads to those people when they browse Facebook. You can set this up with companies like <a href="https://www.perfectaudience.com/facebookretargeting/">Perfect Audience</a>, <a href="http://www.adroll.com/facebook_exchange">AdRoll</a>, and <a href="https://retargeter.com/product-detail-fbx">ReTargeter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2) Create custom audiences</strong></p>
<p>Retargeting is a good way to reach high intent potential customers. But, the limitation to retargeting ads is that your max reach is the total number of people coming to your site. So, how do you get more reach but still hyper-target.</p>
<p>Custom audiences on Facebook is an area that I&#8217;m super excited about. You can simply upload a list of email addresses of people you want to target, and your ad will get in front of a subset of those people. Pretty amazing. Here&#8217;s how to do this:</p>
<p>A) In the Ads Manager within your account, click on &#8220;Audiences&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/audiences.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5952 alignleft" title="audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/audiences.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Click on &#8220;Create Audiences&#8221;.  Then select &#8220;Data File Custom Audience&#8221;.  Upload your CSV file with your list of email addresses &#8212; people you would like to get your ad campaign in front of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/createaudiences.png"><img class=" wp-image-5953 alignleft" title="Create audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/createaudiences-700x355.png" alt="" width="490" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what list of email addresses should you upload? You could upload your list of prospectives &#8212; people who signed up for your free trial or perhaps your ebook or white paper. Alternatively, if you don&#8217;t have a large list of prospective customers, we at LaunchBit can help you <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/pdf/launchbit-audience-targeting.pdf">generate a list through our custom audiences program</a> and run those ads for you.  This program is in beta.</p>
<p><strong>3) Create look-alike custom audiences</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, once you have a list of custom audiences, Facebook can help you augment your reach further by getting your campaign in front of other people who are similar to those on your list. Unlike their old targeting options, this feature allows you to decide how closely similar you want this augmented audience to be. Here&#8217;s how to set this up:</p>
<p>A) Once you have followed the steps to create a custom audience above, go to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor/">Power Editor</a> and select &#8220;Ad Tools&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adtools.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5957 alignleft" title="Ad tools" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adtools.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">B) Select your custom audience list and then press &#8220;Create Lookalike Audience&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lookalike.png"><img class="wp-image-5958 alignleft" title="Lookalike audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lookalike-700x315.png" alt="" width="490" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you advertise in a super targeted way?</p>

<p>Creating pricing plans is one of the more difficult tasks that a marketer can do. SaaS pricing is especially interesting, because small changes in price can compound and make a huge difference in the end. For example, raising a price by just $5 per month can mean an additional $60 per year per customer. So I was curious to see how SaaS companies change their pricing over time.</p>
<p><strong>A snapshot of SaaS pricing</strong></p>
<p>Since we didn&#8217;t have a database of SaaS pricing, I used the <a href="https://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a> to take a look at pricing from 7 companies over the last few years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.olark.com">Olark</a></li>
<li><a href="www.snapengage.com">SnapEngage</a></li>
<li><a href="www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a></li>

<li><a href="www.visualwebsiteoptimizer.com">Visual Website Optimizer</a></li>
<li><a href="www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though 7 companies do not represent the SaaS market as a whole, they do provide some insight into some patterns that SaaS companies go through over time.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-do-saas-companies-change-their-pricing-over-time/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>Even though 7 companies do not represent the SaaS market as a whole, they do provide some insight into some patterns that SaaS companies go through over time. Here&#8217;s what I found:</p>
<p><strong>1) Pricing tends to go up dramatically if it goes up</strong></p>
<p>This might seem obvious. It seems everyone on the internet <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/08/13/doubling-saas-revenue/">encourages SaaS companies to raise prices to double their revenue</a>.</p>
<p>But, the trend, in which, pricing tends to go up might be less obvious. Pricing, when it goes up, seems to increase dramatically at one point within the first couple of years of a company finding product-market fit.  Olark is a good example of this. They nearly doubled their prices for a number of their packages.  This was also the case for KISSmetrics, SnapEngage, and Mixpanel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-14-at-12.48.29-PM1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" title="Olark pricing" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-14-at-12.48.29-PM1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the most dramatic increases appeared to occur in the mid-tier packages.  (Pure speculation: perhaps mid-tier packages tend to be the most popular packages and where changing the price has the greatest impact on revenue)</p>
<p>We were surprised, though, that not all companies raised prices. Basecamp and Optimizely are great examples of companies that have not raised their prices at all in the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>2) Companies remove the lowest priced package</strong></p>
<p>This also may seem obvious. We noticed that companies removed their lowest priced package also within the first couple of years of finding product-market fit.  For example, KISSmetrics removed their $29 package. Mixpanel removed their $25 package. SnapEngage removed their $19 package.</p>
<p><strong>3) Even self-serve SaaS companies have enterprise packages</strong></p>
<p>With so much talk about how SaaS should be self-serve, many of these companies had enterprise packages that did not display prices public. Most of these companies did not publicly post a package posted that was greater than $1000+ per month.  Note: the exceptions to this was Visual Website Optimizer which had a $1700 per month package that was removed within a year and, Mixpanel, which has been posting several $1000+ per month self-serve packages over the last couple of years.   (It seems like their customers have high-limit credit cards these days&#8230;)</p>
<p>Disclaimers: again, small sample set &#8212; no way representative of the entire SaaS industry.  Also, it&#8217;s unclear whether any of these companies are/were split-testing their pricing, so I may have been locked into one of their tests, and the pricing that I see may be different from others. (What else would you expect when you&#8217;re looking at Optimizely and Visual Website Optimizer&#8217;s sites?)</p>
<p>That said, if you believe these companies are a good benchmark for SaaS companies to emulate, the takeaways may be to try testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant increase in your prices &#8212; especially your mid-tier packages.  Perhaps even double your price.</li>
<li>The removal of  your lowest-priced package</li>
<li>The removal of all packages over $1k per month and replacing it with an enterprise sales funnel</li>
</ul>
<p>What pricing tests have you done?</p>

<p>Blog writing is tough. You write a post. You create a headline. But often, you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the best headline that will drive optimal traffic.</p>
<p>So our friends over at <a href="https://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a> had a clever idea. Why not <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog">&#8220;split test&#8221; headlines using Twitter</a>? (&#8220;Split test&#8221; is in quotes, because you cannot actually split test on Twitter using the truest definition of the phrase, but you can come close&#8230;)  Using this method, they were able to increase traffic to one of their blog posts by 100%.</p>

<p>Blog writing is tough. You write a post. You create a headline. But often, you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the best headline that will drive optimal traffic.</p>
<p>So our friends over at <a href="https://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a> had a clever idea. Why not <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog">&#8220;split test&#8221; headlines using Twitter</a>? (&#8220;Split test&#8221; is in quotes, because you cannot actually split test on Twitter using the truest definition of the phrase, but you can come close&#8230;)  Using this method, they were able to increase traffic to one of their blog posts by 100%.</p>
<p><strong>How to split test blog headlines using Twitter</strong></p>
<p>So how did they do it? Pretty simply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) They wrote a post.<br />
2) They came up with two relevant headlines.<br />
3) They Buffered each of these headlines to tweet about an hour apart from each other.<br />
4) They analyzed the number of clicks and noticed the second headline garnered about 2x as many clicks &#8212; thus, a winning headline!</p>
<p>Very clever! Except for one thing: <em>their conclusions were wrong</em>.</p>
<p><strong>How to *really* split test using Twitter</strong><br />
So what was wrong with their test? Well, the flaw in this analysis stems from the fact that you can&#8217;t actually split test using Twitter &#8212; as in, you cannot show one tweet to half of your followers and another tweet to the other half.  Some people will end up seeing both headlines. And one headline may have significantly more views than the other, and this is what ended up happening in their test.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buffer1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5910" title="Buffer headline 1" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buffer1-700x139.png" alt="" width="560" height="111" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buffer2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5909" title="Buffer headline 2" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/buffer2-700x138.png" alt="" width="560" height="110" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog">Buffer</a></em></p>
<p>You cannot just look at clicks to determine whether a headline is better. With Buffer&#8217;s winning headline, you can see that it also received 2x as many views as the first headline. So how do you reconcile which headline is better when the two headlines are not even getting the same number of views?</p>
<p>In another life, I was a stats tutor and stats TA for a class at MIT, and I could show you some fancy math to figure this out. But, I found a site called <a href="http://www.splittester.com/">SplitTester.com</a> that can do this math for us.  Let&#8217;s walk through the steps to split test a headline correctly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Follow Buffer&#8217;s suggested steps #1-#3. Write your post. Come up with two relevant headlines. Tweet the two headlines about an hour apart.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) Take a look at your click and potential reach numbers. Compute your click-through-rate, which is your total # of clicks / potential reach. In this case, 40/15,300 = 0.26% CTR and 81/32,600 = 0.25% CTR for the two respective headline ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) Then plug in your click and click-through-rate numbers into <a href="http://www.splittester.com/">SplitTester.com</a> and press Calculate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/splitester1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5922" title="splitester" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/splitester1-700x237.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Voila! &#8212; it tells us that there is no winning headline.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-08-at-9.16.32-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5923" title="split test results" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-08-at-9.16.32-AM-700x123.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>In other words, there was no winner between the two headlines that Buffer tested.  However, their general testing process is good, and we used it to improve our headlines.  We ran 18 headline split tests, and only 1 yielded a better result!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-08-at-8.58.58-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5913" title="Screen Shot 2014-05-08 at 8.58.58 AM" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-08-at-8.58.58-AM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>It is challenging to come up with a better headline that will significantly increase your blog traffic. In fact, AppSumo has found that, in general, only <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/a-b-testing-tips/">1 out of 8 split tests yields meaningful results</a>.</p>
<p>That said, if you put in the work, this is a great free method to find a powerful headline to increase your blog traffic.  And, it works even if you don&#8217;t have a lot of Twitter followers.</p>
<p>Do you split test blog headlines to increase your traffic? How?</p>
