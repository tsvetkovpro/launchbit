When I published this post, someone on <a href="http://quibb.com/links/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads">Quibb</a>, asked me how our blog efforts compare to all our other content marketing efforts in generating leads.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our content marketing activities at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> and how they compare against each other. (Note: Our content marketing pales in comparison to efforts of much larger software companies, so this is by no means what is considered optimal &#8212; it&#8217;s just how we do things at LaunchBit)</p>
<p><strong>Webinars: 100-600 leads per webinar</strong></p>

<p>Webinars are by far one of our best content marketing activities.  Typically, we&#8217;ll partner with a complementary company, create slides together, and share the webinar time.  Both parties will promote the webinar through email marketing, encouraging people to sign up, and these leads are shared between the two companies.  As such, we don&#8217;t partner with companies that have aggressive email marketing.  We make sure that we have a solid fit with a company before deciding to partner with them.</p>
<p>Webinars are a lot of work, though. Putting together slides, coordinating meetings to decide content and rehearse, and finally doing post-production on a video all takes time &#8211; probably about 20-30 hours in total.  We are not currently doing lead generation on the webinar videos we generate, so this activity currently does not yield subsequent lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>Blog: 100 leads per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6103" title="Blog" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z-640x426.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="http://www.manoftaste.de/" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="25">www.manoftaste.de</a></em></p>
<p>We mentioned in our last post that we are currently generating about 30 leads per month (roughly 100 leads per quarter) on our blog.  We have blogged as often as 4x per week but currently blog 1-2x per week.  Each blog post takes approximately 2-4 hours to write and edit.  If we blog once a week for a whole quarter and can drive approximately 100 leads, then blogging starts to rival a webinar.  Unlike webinars which just generate one tranche of leads, blogging can potentially lead to greater, continuous lead generation if we can continue to increase traffic to our blog.</p>
<p><strong>eBooks: a handful per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6105" title="ebooks" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/melenita/9367687811/in/photolist-fgMRdP-dMQfRy-edG67m-4r6YTx-cJHPxd-7ZjXmZ-q94-7rSGV1-b6eHZz-8dKu2N-fFqAhr-7sVUjY-8NJGd6-dhSkmk-8xXVaK-8pfWZ3-bk61n6-b6eHYR-8kz5N-arvo63-6K4Dnu-8Dcd9y-yfiPv-9sgWMR-6az3Fs-6Retwu-8Dcagq-8dKtZ5-a7rCv8-8D94Ei-6gQoE5-7S8qtM-4Y7jvR-6aVL6Q-b6eHZ8-9KGtx3-fLfiUx-62u8pf-dxKLhJ-8dGeLn-f9vyKR-7cDUKY-5C86TR-6gQoJY-6gLdh8-6gLdfP-6gQoFd-8dKueE-dMJGnM-8MHcUt">Maria Elena</a></em></p>
<p>Our eBooks, in general, don&#8217;t yield a lot of organic leads.  <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/improve-the-roi-of-your-content-marketing-recap/">Paid marketing works well for eBook signups</a>, especially through LaunchBit&#8217;s integrations with publisher partners.  But, as far as free leads go, we only get a handful in a given quarter.  In part, our eBooks also tend to be hidden on their own special landing pages that are disconnected from our website.  eBooks also take a lot of time to put together.  They can take 2-4 weeks of calendar time and about 80 hours of work, including design, writing, editing, and formatting.  That said, because eBooks are great for generating paid leads, they are worthwhile if you are running paid campaigns (and we are).</p>
<p><strong>Books: unknown</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6106" title="books" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/61423903@N06/7357608430/in/photolist-cdaEDL-7gc2rv-5t7uJJ-icWej8-51mJzS-jEaUkN-7yy8k8-72Lhev-4fNJ8u-dksMMw-gFA2zs-4S3Rz-dXDrCi-bbCsgV-PZmWU-dphnAE-Zaprp-9t3w-4ceX98-MVmkH-a9R8Ca-7m5SbQ-fppyGr-cEHvLj-7xMoXo-4tqvEc-5BTZjt-33MFv8-kJYLhg-t6cAk-5oK63e-9qJTTP-815VLA-PGhq-4cr2hy-fsYVnU-6q6CnC-6Uccv-7uJEYD-e8DYeU-61T8sa-4nkMU2-d5CHJ5-72DYa6-3HcK46-cFssXu-8DCUdi-72UGw5-j6pg8a-7tZvJ2">FutUndBeitl</a></em></p>
<p>Lastly, we are currently writing a &#8220;regular book&#8221; on email marketing. Unlike an eBook, regular books tend to be higher quality, and in fact, we&#8217;re going to be selling our book on Amazon.  The email marketing book we&#8217;re writing has taken a couple years of calendar time and about 300-400 hours of design, copywriting, and editing&#8230;and still counting.  We are not sure whether this activity is worthwhile for lead generation, but we have decided to give this a shot, because we had enough content to write a solid book.  We hope you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a great book, too!</p>
<p>In short, webinars are currently the best organic lead generation activity for us, but based on the trajectory of our blog traffic, we expect our blog lead generation to overtake webinars in the next few months and show greater ROI for our content creation time.</p>
<p>What are the most effective pieces of content for your lead generation?</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I read a great post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2014/03/11/get-first-100-email-subscribers/">How to get your first 100 email subscribers</a> by Bryan Harris for <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan&#8217;s blog</a>. The author placed leadboxes around his blog and shared where he was able to get the most email signups for his email newsletter.</p>
<p>We were curious and decided to conduct a similar experiment for the last month (5/5-5/26). In fact, we straight up copied some of his ideas. In particular, what we wanted to know was whether these lead generation ideas would help us even though we have a small blog.  We get between 1000-6000 blog visitors a month.  Here are our results:</p>
<p><strong>1) Byline leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We replicated this idea directly from Bryan.  For every post, we wrote a &#8220;byline&#8221; telling people to &#8220;Get updates of new posts here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6055" title="Byline lead generation" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png" alt="" width="465" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>When someone clicks the byline a leadbox pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6056" title="Byline lead generation popup" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png" alt="" width="447" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Bryan talks about a 0.6% conversion rate with this lead capture method on his blog, but it&#8217;s unclear to me whether this is a conversion percentage based on total impressions of the byline link or of the popup.  Regardless, for us, we had a 0% conversion rate &#8211; no one signed up!</p>
<p>That said, the click-through-rate on the byline link was quite low at 0.09%.   So, split testing this method would not be worthwhile for us.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Post-footer leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also placed a leadbox below each blog post encouraging people to sign up for our email newsletter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6057" title="Footer leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png" alt="" width="468" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>The results on this leadbox were fairly poor.  In May, seven people subscribed to our newsletter via this box.  There were across 4183 non-unique impressions of this footer box in May.  This method of lead generation probably isn&#8217;t worth optimizing, because even if we 10x-ed our results, the conversion rate would still be low.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.2% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Sidebar leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox on the upper right side of our blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6058" title="Sidebar leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM-700x291.png" alt="" width="490" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>The byline and footer leadboxes were fairly hidden, so to be honest, I didn&#8217;t expect them to do very well.  But, I did expect this sidebar lead generation box to perform a lot better.  However, we saw just 1 conversion!  The results were even worse than the footer leadbox.</p>
<p>Bryan uses a sidebar leadbox that scrolls as a reader is reading a post and achieved an 0.8% conversion rate on his blog.  If we were to modify this sidebar leadbox, we would likely try a similar strategy with a auto-scrolling box.  I speculate that perhaps our blog visitors are not interested in signing up to read more posts until they&#8217;ve actually read one first, so an auto-scrolling box might help with conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.02% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Header leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox at the top of our blog.  This header leadbox, however, did/does not show up at the top of specific blog posts.  It only shows up on our blog synopsis page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6060" title="Header leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM-700x293.png" alt="" width="490" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the ideal placement (you cannot possibly miss this!), I&#8217;d expected this leadbox to do quite well.  However, this leadbox received 0 signups!</p>
<p>Like the sidebar widget, perhaps, if this header appeared after someone read one of our posts, then it might perform better. A future experiment might be to show this header leadbox on specific blog posts and scroll as a reader reads a post.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) Timed pop-up leadbox</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we implemented the <a href="http://sumome.com/">SumoMe</a> leadbox for our blog.  This leadbox pops up in the middle of the blog after a certain amount of time.  It shows up on any of our blog pages.  Compared to all the other leadboxes we&#8217;ve tried, this popup performed the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.46.44-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6061" title="Popup leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.46.44-PM.png" alt="" width="413" height="358" /></a></p>
<p>Bryan was able to get a 5%+ conversion rate on his blog.  Although our conversion rate was not nearly as high, these results are definitely at a good point to start tweaking.  In less than one month, we were able to get 19 new email signups from this one tactic.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.7% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p>Although a total of 27 new leads across all five tactics is not a lot, if we leave them up for the next 2 months, we&#8217;ll be able to hit 100 new subscribers from organic traffic for just a couple of hours of work that it took to place these leadboxes on our site.  With some tweaking of the leadboxes, we might be able to get some multiple on email signups as well.  And obviously if we can grow our blog, that will lead to a multiple in signups as well.</p>
<p>I was initially skeptical that a small blog like ours could get a significant number of leads from these different tactics.  And while a larger blog could achieve so many more leads for the same amount of work, the results haven&#8217;t been bad for us.  A lot of B2B companies value email signups at $5-$30 per lead, and we&#8217;re no different.  For a small blog like ours, we now see that a couple hours of work leads to recurring $100-1000 in new value per month.  Trying these leadbox tactics has been worthwhile, and I would recommend giving some of these ideas a whirl on your own blog for your own email marketing program.</p>
<p>What leadboxes do you use on your site?</p>

<p>Twitter cards are essentially apps that run within <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. One type of card that is particularly interesting to marketers is the Twitter Lead Generation card. We&#8217;ve previously written about <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-use-twitter-cards-for-b2b-lead-generation-3/">how to set it up</a>, but what can you do with it? How do you use it to encourage people to sign up for your email mailing list? 3 clever ideas we&#8217;ve seen:</p>

<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them.

How do you use it to encourage people to sign up for your email mailing list? 3 clever ideas we&#8217;ve seen:</p>
<p><strong>1) Thank</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them. Ryan realized this was an opportunity to encourage people to sign up for his mailing list so that he could continue to reach these people with subsequent posts that might be useful to them.</p>
<p>So, he created a Twitter Lead Generation card for his mailing list, and each time he thanked people on Twitter, he encouraged them to also sign up for his mailing list.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://draftin.com/images/3964?token=Vj7I6rinEEaEwaEo8b37Esw3axYvtagQNPn4UzrOTfc9pra8cJ9NEeKBSMM3joDt2I7YNENzyJ8v7z8dB9ABxEg" alt="" width="531" height="682" /></p>
<p><em>image courtesy of <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/67662891557/grow-your-email-list-with-this-simple-twitter-hack">Ryan Hoover</a></em></p>
<p>The neat thing about this approach was that with one-click, people could easily sign up to receive subsequent posts, and he was engaging with an audience that wanted to hear from him.  <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/67662891557/grow-your-email-list-with-this-simple-twitter-hack">Read his full post on this here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Run a contest</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockcreek.com">Rock/Creek</a> uses Twitter Lead Generation Cards to increase signups for their mailing list. They generated 1700 leads in one week for a contest that would give away a new pair of sandals.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/lead-generation-card-now-available-to-all-advertisers-with-new-features">Read more about how they did this here &gt;&gt; </a></p>
<p><strong>3) Giveaways and freebies</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you can give freebies to people who sign up for your mailing list. We&#8217;ve seen everything from free icons/images/clip art for designers to free coffees to free content. A cautionary note: if you&#8217;re trying to maximize your ROI on your email signups, you probably want to give away something that is aligned with your business. Giving away a free coffee as a B2B business might not attract the most relevant leads. But, giving away designer files or templates if you&#8217;re aiming to reach designers would be a great offer.</p>
<p>How have you used Twitter Lead Generation Cards?  Has it been effective?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Want more cheap leads? How about free leads? A lot of marketers leave free leads on the table, because they don&#8217;t even think about how they can better optimize their lead generation process.</p>
<p>Here are 3 free ways to get more leads:</p>
<p><strong>1) Promote your ebook/white paper/webinar/other piece of content in your email signature</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email_signature.png"><img class="wp-image-5879" title="email_signature" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email_signature.png" alt="" width="434" height="346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heck, ask everyone at your company to place this piece of content in their email signature! Your email signature is typically wasted space, and yet everyone sends so many emails every day. This idea is courtesy of Hubspot &#8211; for more tips, check out their <a href="http://advertisers.launchbit.com/testb2bchannels/?utm_source=email&#38;utm_medium=resources&#38;utm_campaign=whitepaper">full list of lead generation suggestions</a>.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/unusual-ways-to-generate-leads/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p><strong>2) Create a poll</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Lead generation poll" src="http://okdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/contest-zagg-videofruit.png" alt="" width="438" height="368" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>courtesy of Bryan Harris</em></p>
<p>People don&#8217;t want to just sign up for your mailing list. They need a hook to be drawn into your content. Creating a poll or a survey is one of the best ways to do that. Your users/prospects will enjoy voting on your poll, and if it&#8217;s an interesting enough poll, they&#8217;ll want to sign up to get the results as well.</p>
<p><strong>3) Turn your blog posts into ebooks and gate them</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://okdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/free-ebook-ramit.png" alt="" width="574" height="486" /></p>
<p><em>courtesy of <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">Ramit Sethi</a></em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t have time to write a full-fledge ebook?  No need.  Repackage your blog content into ebooks.  Heck, even just one blog post can become an ebook.  All you need is a clean layout with your polished blog post, and you can put together gated landing pages to capture new leads.</p>
<p>These ideas (#2 and #3) are courtesy of Bryan Harris &#8211; for more tips, check out his <a href="http://okdork.com/2014/03/11/get-first-100-email-subscribers/">full list of lead generation tips</a>.</p>

<h1>Who Should Use Pay-Per-Click Advertising and Who Shouldn&#8217;t</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/roundup-click.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5773" title="Click" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/roundup-click.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong></strong>Chances are, you&#8217;ve heard about the amazing return on investment that can be had with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. A return of 300 percent or even higher isn&#8217;t at all unusual with this form of advertising. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231667#">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<h1>Inventor of World Wide Web Criticizes Online Advertising</h1>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has little positive to say about advertisers who dress their online ads up to look like content.He also slammed Microsoft&#8217;s practice of attaching ads to emails sent by users of its Hotmail service, saying that it &#8220;either perverts or distorts the message.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1284697/tim-berners-lee-criticises-online-advertising---archive-web25">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<p>San Francisco-based company’s ad rates droppe<span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span> in the final three months of last year, marking the seventh straight quarter of such declines. Twitter is actually pulling in an increasing amount of revenue from ads because more users are engaging with them by clicking on links, or by retweeting or favoriting them. <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/twitter-tests-click-to-call-button-in-sponsored-ads/#!zrMMQ">Read more…</a></p>

<h1>Who Should Use Pay-Per-Click Advertising and Who Shouldn&#8217;t</h1>

<p><strong></strong>Chances are, you&#8217;ve heard about the amazing return on investment that can be had with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. A return of 300 percent or even higher isn&#8217;t at all unusual with this form of advertising. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231667#">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has little positive to say about advertisers who dress their online ads up to look like content.He also slammed Microsoft&#8217;s practice of attaching ads to emails sent by users of its Hotmail service, saying that it &#8220;either perverts or distorts the message.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1284697/tim-berners-lee-criticises-online-advertising---archive-web25">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<p>San Francisco-based company’s ad rates droppe<span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span> in the final three months of last year, marking the seventh straight quarter of such declines. Twitter is actually pulling in an increasing amount of revenue from ads because more users are engaging with them by clicking on links, or by retweeting or favoriting them. <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/twitter-tests-click-to-call-button-in-sponsored-ads/#!zrMMQ">Read more…</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m here to tell you that headlines are THE MOST important element to split test</strong>, and thus, that is where you should start. The headline is the most important thing that you can split test because it is<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/"> the first “gateway”</a> that your readers have to pass through. On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only <a href="http://mediacorpus.com/truth-8020-rule/">2 out of 10 will read the rest</a>. This means that you will lose more people at the headline than anywhere else on the page, so test the headline first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it’s the first thing that your visitors will read, the headline of your landing page offers the biggest opportunity for improvements in conversion rate. Make it compelling, because<a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html"> you only have 0-8 seconds</a> to make an impression on your visitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You still think headlines aren’t THAT important?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you heard the story about advertising legend David Ogilvy, who rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement <strong>104 times</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5623" title="Rolls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is someone who clearly understood the power of headlines, and how the headline literally determined whether his content would get read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here another example. Adam Mordecai of Upworthy (formerly The Onion) says that he writes<a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"> 25 headlines for every post</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5622" title="blue text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blue-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, writing a great headline doesn’t guarantee success, but the better your headline, the better your chances of getting your content read and your visitors taking action. The benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied with your offer on the rest of your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every marketer would love to see an increase in clicks or conversions and we know that headlines have a BIG impact in making this happen.  Still, many many many b2b marketers underestimate just how important headlines are and how they can make a difference in getting more eyes on your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are a big deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why, again?</strong> Because it’s the first thing people will see. Not the text copy, not the form, not even the call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-write-headlines/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5621" title="KISSmetrics text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KISSmetrics-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s the takeaway?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are the MOST important landing page element to split test because they are what compel visitors to click, or read, or share, or convert. So spend considerable time writing your headlines and split testing to improve them. Many marketers spend A LOT of time testing various elements of their landing pages (<em>button colors are overrated</em>), but then just put any old headline at the top without realizing that in doing so they might not be ensuring that they are actually persuading their visitors to convert.</p>

<p><em>Image credit: b2bsecrets.com</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">This scenario happens quite often and leaves a lot of b2b marketers with a decision to make. To split test or not to split test. We all know what split testing is and that it can surely improve landing page results if it’s done correctly, but how many of us have actually tried it and received results we could take action with? I’m guessing not many. Even if you&#8217;ve been thinking about split testing for a while, you might be wondering just exactly how much time you should spend on it?</p>
<p>The answer really depends on the size of your company – how many employees you have to put time into it, how much you have to pay for it, and how much traffic you receive to your landing page on a monthly basis. The more of these things you have, the more practical split testing will be. The less of these things, the less time and energy you should put into testing. Let’s expand on the most important of these things &#8211; traffic. You first need to make sure you have enough visitors going to your landing pages that will give you significant results during your split tests.</p>
<p><strong>So how many visitors are enough?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To get good numbers in your split testing efforts that will actually have an impact on your conversion rates, you should have a minimum of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=brand&amp;utm_campaign=G_WW_Search_Brand">100 visitors to each landing page and at least 20 conversions</a>. This means you need enough visitors to increase your conversion rate. This also means you need enough conversions to generate good results. Without this kind of volume, your split testing will not be worth it. That’s the simple truth.  As you grow your traffic and increase your leads you can decide when the return is worth investing more of your time split testing.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/split-test-calculator/">split test calculator</a>, a sort of cheat sheet, for you to try out. You can approximate traffic and conversion rates and see the results. It will help you decide if split testing is worthwhile.</p>
