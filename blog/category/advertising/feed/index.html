<p>Facebook ads have gone through massive transitions over the years. In the beginning, the targeting capabilities were very simple: select demographic options and get your campaign in front of people who met those demographics. The problem with this was that you didn&#8217;t have the ability to go granular in your campaign. If you wanted to reach small business owners, they put your ad in front of EVERYONE who was even remotely involved with a small business. But what if you just wanted to reach say small business owners who were Constant Contact users? There wasn&#8217;t a way to get that granular.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/three-ways-to-reach-hyper-targeted-business-audiences-using-facebook/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.02-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5964" title="Hyper-targeted audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.02-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Facebook ads have gone through massive transitions over the years. In the beginning, the targeting capabilities were very simple: select demographic options and get your campaign in front of people who met those demographics. The problem with this was that you didn&#8217;t have the ability to go granular in your campaign. If you wanted to reach small business owners, they put your ad in front of EVERYONE who was even remotely involved with a small business. But what if you just wanted to reach say small business owners who were Constant Contact users? There wasn&#8217;t a way to get that granular.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook has an immense number of ad targeting options that most people don&#8217;t know about but are really powerful. Here are 3 ways to hyper-targeted business audiences on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>1) Retarget visitors to your site</strong></p>
<p>This is the most well-known of the three options. You can cookie visitors to your site and then display ads to those people when they browse Facebook. You can set this up with companies like <a href="https://www.perfectaudience.com/facebookretargeting/">Perfect Audience</a>, <a href="http://www.adroll.com/facebook_exchange">AdRoll</a>, and <a href="https://retargeter.com/product-detail-fbx">ReTargeter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2) Create custom audiences</strong></p>
<p>Retargeting is a good way to reach high intent potential customers. But, the limitation to retargeting ads is that your max reach is the total number of people coming to your site. So, how do you get more reach but still hyper-target.</p>
<p>Custom audiences on Facebook is an area that I&#8217;m super excited about. You can simply upload a list of email addresses of people you want to target, and your ad will get in front of a subset of those people. Pretty amazing. Here&#8217;s how to do this:</p>
<p>A) In the Ads Manager within your account, click on &#8220;Audiences&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/audiences.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5952 alignleft" title="audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/audiences.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Click on &#8220;Create Audiences&#8221;.  Then select &#8220;Data File Custom Audience&#8221;.  Upload your CSV file with your list of email addresses &#8212; people you would like to get your ad campaign in front of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/createaudiences.png"><img class=" wp-image-5953 alignleft" title="Create audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/createaudiences-700x355.png" alt="" width="490" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what list of email addresses should you upload? You could upload your list of prospectives &#8212; people who signed up for your free trial or perhaps your ebook or white paper. Alternatively, if you don&#8217;t have a large list of prospective customers, we at LaunchBit can help you <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/pdf/launchbit-audience-targeting.pdf">generate a list through our custom audiences program</a> and run those ads for you.  This program is in beta.</p>
<p><strong>3) Create look-alike custom audiences</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, once you have a list of custom audiences, Facebook can help you augment your reach further by getting your campaign in front of other people who are similar to those on your list. Unlike their old targeting options, this feature allows you to decide how closely similar you want this augmented audience to be. Here&#8217;s how to set this up:</p>
<p>A) Once you have followed the steps to create a custom audience above, go to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor/">Power Editor</a> and select &#8220;Ad Tools&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adtools.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5957 alignleft" title="Ad tools" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adtools.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">B) Select your custom audience list and then press &#8220;Create Lookalike Audience&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lookalike.png"><img class="wp-image-5958 alignleft" title="Lookalike audiences" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lookalike-700x315.png" alt="" width="490" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you advertise in a super targeted way?</p>

<p><strong></strong>Chances are, you&#8217;ve heard about the amazing return on investment that can be had with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.

<p>Beginning this week, customers of the Microsoft Advertising Exchange will have a clearer view into the inventory available in our marketplace. I want to share some thoughts on this exciting step forward. When Microsoft first launched our Ad Exchange, the RTB space was still relatively new. <a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/en-us/blogpost/129028/microsoft-advertising-blog/microsoft-improves-advertising-exchange-transparency">Read more&#8230;</a></p>

<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-headlines-are-the-most-important-landing-page-element-to-split-test/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5603" title="jump" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m here to tell you that headlines are THE MOST important element to split test</strong>, and thus, that is where you should start. The headline is the most important thing that you can split test because it is<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/"> the first “gateway”</a> that your readers have to pass through. On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only <a href="http://mediacorpus.com/truth-8020-rule/">2 out of 10 will read the rest</a>. This means that you will lose more people at the headline than anywhere else on the page, so test the headline first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it’s the first thing that your visitors will read, the headline of your landing page offers the biggest opportunity for improvements in conversion rate. Make it compelling, because<a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html"> you only have 0-8 seconds</a> to make an impression on your visitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You still think headlines aren’t THAT important?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you heard the story about advertising legend David Ogilvy, who rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement <strong>104 times</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5623" title="Rolls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is someone who clearly understood the power of headlines, and how the headline literally determined whether his content would get read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here another example. Adam Mordecai of Upworthy (formerly The Onion) says that he writes<a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"> 25 headlines for every post</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5622" title="blue text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blue-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, writing a great headline doesn’t guarantee success, but the better your headline, the better your chances of getting your content read and your visitors taking action. The benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied with your offer on the rest of your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every marketer would love to see an increase in clicks or conversions and we know that headlines have a BIG impact in making this happen.  Still, many many many b2b marketers underestimate just how important headlines are and how they can make a difference in getting more eyes on your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are a big deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why, again?</strong> Because it’s the first thing people will see. Not the text copy, not the form, not even the call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-write-headlines/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5621" title="KISSmetrics text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KISSmetrics-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s the takeaway?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are the MOST important landing page element to split test because they are what compel visitors to click, or read, or share, or convert. So spend considerable time writing your headlines and split testing to improve them. Many marketers spend A LOT of time testing various elements of their landing pages (<em>button colors are overrated</em>), but then just put any old headline at the top without realizing that in doing so they might not be ensuring that they are actually persuading their visitors to convert.</p>

<p><em>Image credit: b2bsecrets.com</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">This scenario happens quite often and leaves a lot of b2b marketers with a decision to make. To split test or not to split test. We all know what split testing is and that it can surely improve landing page results if it’s done correctly, but how many of us have actually tried it and received results we could take action with? I’m guessing not many. Even if you&#8217;ve been thinking about split testing for a while, you might be wondering just exactly how much time you should spend on it?</p>
<p>The answer really depends on the size of your company – how many employees you have to put time into it, how much you have to pay for it, and how much traffic you receive to your landing page on a monthly basis. The more of these things you have, the more practical split testing will be. The less of these things, the less time and energy you should put into testing. Let’s expand on the most important of these things &#8211; traffic. You first need to make sure you have enough visitors going to your landing pages that will give you significant results during your split tests.</p>
<p><strong>So how many visitors are enough?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To get good numbers in your split testing efforts that will actually have an impact on your conversion rates, you should have a minimum of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=brand&amp;utm_campaign=G_WW_Search_Brand">100 visitors to each landing page and at least 20 conversions</a>. This means you need enough visitors to increase your conversion rate. This also means you need enough conversions to generate good results. Without this kind of volume, your split testing will not be worth it. That’s the simple truth.  As you grow your traffic and increase your leads you can decide when the return is worth investing more of your time split testing.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/split-test-calculator/">split test calculator</a>, a sort of cheat sheet, for you to try out. You can approximate traffic and conversion rates and see the results. It will help you decide if split testing is worthwhile.</p>

<p>A lot of B2B advertisers ask us what a good click-through-rate is for their ads. In fact, about <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/b2b-insights/">30% of B2B marketers judge the performance of their ad campaigns by their click-through-rate</a>.  However, measuring whether the click-through-rate of your ad campaign is &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; is complicated and sometimes impossible.</p>
<p><strong>What causes high click-through-rates?</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dissect what makes for a good click-through-rate: ad positioning, targeting &amp; context, creative &amp; copy, and ad format.</p>
<p><strong>1) Ad positioning</strong></p>
<p>This is the placement of the ad. On a website, banner ads are typically placed on the right side of the page. Sometimes there are banners across the top and footers of a webpage as well. If you hold other factors constant, the position alone will heavily influence whether people click on your ad. Afterall, the more prominent the ad positioning, the more likely someone will click on it.</p>
<p>With display campaigns, when there is a discrepancy in click-through-rate between two blog or newsletter publishers, it&#8217;s very often the ad positioning that makes up the discrepancy. In these cases, it&#8217;s hard to say that one publisher is &#8220;better&#8221; than another by looking at the click-through-rate alone. Sometimes discrepancies in click-through-rate based on ad placement alone can be orders of magnitude different between publishers.</p>
<p><strong>2) Targeting &amp; context</strong></p>
<p>This is how well an ad network matches an ad with the right audience. Ad networks like Google use their search engine to match ads with consumers&#8217; searches. Display ad networks tend to use context of the content to match ads with visitors.</p>
<p><strong>3) Creative &amp; copy</strong></p>
<p>This is the ad creative that an advertiser submits. This matters a lot. Having a good product that excites people isn&#8217;t enough. Creating ads that catch attention, and constantly testing and refreshing ad creatives so that they continue to catch attention is important in keeping click-through-rates high.</p>
<p><strong>4) Ad format </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, ad format affects click-through-rates. Click-through-rates on banner ads have <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/05/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/">dropped from typical click-through-rates of 70%+ to &lt; 0.1% over the last two decades</a>.  In contrast, the click-through-rates on Twitter ads or Facebook ads are quite high, because they are prominently placed in their respective feeds and are made to look like the surrounding content.</p>
<p><strong>How to benchmark click-through-rates</strong></p>
<p>With all of these factors affecting click-through-rates, it&#8217;s hard to say that one publisher has a &#8220;low&#8221; click-through-rate simply because the relevancy was poor. It could be that the ad position was hidden. Or the ad format was a small banner.</p>
<p>If click-through-rates are important to you as a B2B advertiser, the <em>wrong benchmark is to compare the click-through-rate across publishers</em>. The correct benchmark is to compare the click-through-rate of your ad on a particular publisher with other ads that have been in that same adzone. This holds the ad-positioning and format constant so that these are not differing factors when you do your click-through-rate comparisons.</p>
<p>Is click-through-rate important to your ad campaigns?</p>

This type of advertising made him so angry that I could hear him bursting a spleen on the phone. I wanted to reach out and give my friend the biggest hug because no one deserves to feel that way about what essentially is the Internet Advertisers Money Making Machine! If you know how to test your B2B Advertising campaigns, you’ll create a money making machine for your company where no advertising channel will ever stress you out.

<p><strong>Calculate your minimum Display Advertising Test Budget</strong></p>
<p>In order to calculate a minimum test budget, you’ll need to use just one formula to get to a minimum test budget. I put together a quick spreadsheet that already does some of the math to create possible ways to calculate your required budget for a test. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoJ_1p8C-CU-dFZEZEVhMDRRRndwYVpQUUhPR3lSS1E&amp;usp=sharing">Make a copy of my Calculator Spreadsheet</a> and try it out and let me know if it works or how I can improve it. Your specific industry and customer acquisition costs and lead conversion rates may vary.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you know your optimum Cost Per Click</strong></p>
<p>The B2B Advertising Money Making Machine is a performance marketing machine. This means that you should only pay out of your budget if your campaign is delivering the exact marketing activity or clicks you require. However, if you bid too low for your clicks, you won’t get enough and if you bid too high, you’ll overpay for clicks and waste a budget. So what’s the secret? It’s best to focus on your click-through-rate over the overall bidding strategy and pay for clicks that are at the maximum clicks you’re getting from your test campaign. Don’t try to be cheap just because you like to pay the lowest price. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Don’t sweat your ad designs</strong></p>
<p>The B2B Advertising Money Machine doesn’t reward more money for the most expensive and the most perfect advertising creatives. Did you know that plain old text offers sometimes convert much better than fancy pictures? It’s the offer that matters most in B2B advertising and delivering offers that matter will reflect in your performance to convert leads in the channel. If you’ve got the right budget at the optimal cost per lead, a weak offer will still sink your campaign.</p>

<p>I was chatting with my co-worker about what days of the week B2B marketers prefer to take out ad campaigns.

I argued that with the rise in <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1963815">Saas dominating the B2B market and growing at nearly 20% YOY</a>, B2B companies are able to acquire customers with less high-touch sales.

<p>I was chatting with my co-worker about what days of the week B2B marketers prefer to take out ad campaigns. He argued that most B2B marketers prefer to take out ads Monday &#8211; Wednesday.  Afterall, enterprise software previously required high touch sales, and sales teams and decision makers don&#8217;t like to work the weekends. I argued that with the rise in <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1963815">Saas dominating the B2B market and growing at nearly 20% YOY</a>, B2B companies are able to acquire customers with less high-touch sales. So, software users can start free trials right away without a credit card &#8212; even on the weekend.</p>
<p>So, we turned to the data in the <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> network to see who was right. Can you guess the most popular day for B2B marketers to take out ads?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-02-at-9.48.04-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5151" title="Screen Shot 2013-12-02 at 9.48.04 PM" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-02-at-9.48.04-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>It turns out that using data from our network (June &#8211; November 2013), overwhelmingly, marketers took out campaigns on Wednesdays. The caveat is that we measured these campaign start times based on Pacific time, even though we have advertisers from around the globe. So, campaigns that started on Sunday Pacific time, for example, may actually be started on Monday local time in say Australia, though this is not considered in this dataset.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not only did marketers prefer Wednesday by a huge margin, but the data also looks somewhat normalized. In other words, Tuesday and Thursday are the next most popular days to start campaigns, and the number of started campaigns decays the further you get from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re a B2B marketer, this data can help you, because if your product does not require a sales person to call down your leads immediately, then you are better off advertising at non peak times to get better prices. Hint: it is true that clicks are cheaper on the weekends, so if you want to take advantage of cheaper clicks, you should definitely think about starting a campaign on a Friday or Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>1. Your competition just ran out of B2B Advertising budget</strong></p>
<p>While speaking with B2B marketers in November, we heard that quite a few of them have run out of marketing budget for 2013 or have their entire remaining budget already assigned. This means your competition has less degrees of marketing freedom at the close of the year, which should increase your odds to win more leads. Isn’t December just an awesome month for smart marketing competition?</p>

<p><strong>2. B2B ad competition and inventory prices seasonally drop in December</strong></p>
<p>As marketers run down their budgets and judge their prospects as not engaged, there is immense cheap inventory of quality eyeballs that you may be missing. At LaunchBit, many of our publishers tell us that they’re cutting costs on inventory as marketers consolidate their final spends. However, email newsletter publishers still have customers reading quality content. The best email newsletters are a daily habit. These habits are resilient, even during the holidays when new users fire up their new mobile phones and tablet gifts to read their email newsletters while on the go.</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sign1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5137" title="sign" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sign1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> <strong>3. Our B2B Email Advertising network is so good, you’ll come back for more</strong></p>
<p>A smart and savvy analytical Paid Search marketer asked me last week Monday, “PPC B2B Email Advertising is a thing?” Yes! It’s a thing and the cost per leads for some of our best customers are as low as $5 per lead. Many B2B marketers aren’t aware that thousands of niche newsletters carry advertising. LaunchBit’s network of more than 4,000 email newsletter publishers want quality advertisement offers that don’t scare their readers. So the bar is set pretty high for advertisers. Our B2B Advertising network is so good, we’re ridiculously confident that winning marketers will come back in January and ask for more.</p>
<p>There’s always a catch with these types of offers so let me inform you before you jump out of your chair and throttle me for this free inventory. This offer will work if your B2B target demographic consists of either <strong>Small Business Owners </strong>or <strong>Programmers/Software Engineers</strong>. We want great B2B advertising offers that encourage readers to engage with your brand and without the hard sell. What are you waiting on! Click the button below now and apply to see if you qualify!</p>

<p>This is actually a huge hangup for most advertisers I meet. Most marketers are too busy managing tons of different activities &#8212; no one has time to come up with a lot of creatives only to test a channel briefly and then scrap it all together. Here are 2 rules for testing a range of creatives.</p>

<p>This is actually a huge hangup for most advertisers I meet. Most marketers are too busy managing tons of different activities &#8212; no one has time to come up with a lot of creatives only to test a channel briefly and then scrap it all together. Here are 2 rules for testing a range of creatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tester.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5126" title="Lab assistant works with laptop" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tester.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image credit: Digitalmarketer.com</em></p>
<p><strong>1) Use a handful of offers</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth your while to come up with a handful of offers that you can use to test every new paid marketing channel. For example, perhaps it&#8217;s 5 different ebooks. This is a technique that companies like <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/free-marketing-resources">Hubspot</a> use.  They&#8217;ll generate a variety of different ebooks and whitepapers and test which ones convert the best. Trying just one offer does not conclusively tell you about a channel, because if people don&#8217;t convert to leads, you don&#8217;t have a sense of whether the problem lies in your offer or with the fit of the channel.</p>
<p>If creating content takes too long, you can try offering hot products or services as incentives. New Relic does this with their <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/10/08/how-many-t-shirts-has-new-relic-given-out-in-the-last-2-years/">t-shirts</a> and helicopters. AppSumo does this with their <a href="http://www.inc.com/nadine-heintz/appsumos-dropbox-pro-giveway.html">software contests</a>. Whatever your offer, make sure you have a handful to test.</p>
<p><strong>2) Your ad design doesn&#8217;t matter</strong></p>
<p>One big reason coming up with multiple creatives is daunting is that most marketers are perfectionists about their creatives and will need time with a designer, and it can take months to get around to testing a channel. Don&#8217;t go down this path. It turns out that unless your target market is designers, you shouldn&#8217;t sweat creatives. In fact, we&#8217;ve found that in our own network, design matters less than specificity of an offer. For example, you are much better off writing in text (even if on a banner ad itself) what your offer is as opposed to showing an aesthetically pleasing graphical design.</p>
<p>Your audience wants to know what you are advertising &#8212; make it easy for them to figure out, and be specific. And, this does not require a designer.</p>
<p>If you follow these two rules, developing creatives to test new paid marketing channels should not be a bear.</p>
