<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m here to tell you that headlines are THE MOST important element to split test</strong>, and thus, that is where you should start. The headline is the most important thing that you can split test because it is<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/"> the first “gateway”</a> that your readers have to pass through. On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only <a href="http://mediacorpus.com/truth-8020-rule/">2 out of 10 will read the rest</a>. This means that you will lose more people at the headline than anywhere else on the page, so test the headline first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it’s the first thing that your visitors will read, the headline of your landing page offers the biggest opportunity for improvements in conversion rate. Make it compelling, because<a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html"> you only have 0-8 seconds</a> to make an impression on your visitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You still think headlines aren’t THAT important?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you heard the story about advertising legend David Ogilvy, who rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement <strong>104 times</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5623" title="Rolls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is someone who clearly understood the power of headlines, and how the headline literally determined whether his content would get read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here another example. Adam Mordecai of Upworthy (formerly The Onion) says that he writes<a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"> 25 headlines for every post</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5622" title="blue text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blue-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, writing a great headline doesn’t guarantee success, but the better your headline, the better your chances of getting your content read and your visitors taking action. The benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied with your offer on the rest of your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every marketer would love to see an increase in clicks or conversions and we know that headlines have a BIG impact in making this happen.  Still, many many many b2b marketers underestimate just how important headlines are and how they can make a difference in getting more eyes on your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are a big deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why, again?</strong> Because it’s the first thing people will see. Not the text copy, not the form, not even the call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-write-headlines/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5621" title="KISSmetrics text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KISSmetrics-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s the takeaway?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are the MOST important landing page element to split test because they are what compel visitors to click, or read, or share, or convert. So spend considerable time writing your headlines and split testing to improve them. Many marketers spend A LOT of time testing various elements of their landing pages (<em>button colors are overrated</em>), but then just put any old headline at the top without realizing that in doing so they might not be ensuring that they are actually persuading their visitors to convert.</p>

<p><em>Image credit: b2bsecrets.com</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">This scenario happens quite often and leaves a lot of b2b marketers with a decision to make. To split test or not to split test. We all know what split testing is and that it can surely improve landing page results if it’s done correctly, but how many of us have actually tried it and received results we could take action with? I’m guessing not many. Even if you&#8217;ve been thinking about split testing for a while, you might be wondering just exactly how much time you should spend on it?</p>
<p>The answer really depends on the size of your company – how many employees you have to put time into it, how much you have to pay for it, and how much traffic you receive to your landing page on a monthly basis. The more of these things you have, the more practical split testing will be. The less of these things, the less time and energy you should put into testing. Let’s expand on the most important of these things &#8211; traffic. You first need to make sure you have enough visitors going to your landing pages that will give you significant results during your split tests.</p>
<p><strong>So how many visitors are enough?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To get good numbers in your split testing efforts that will actually have an impact on your conversion rates, you should have a minimum of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=brand&amp;utm_campaign=G_WW_Search_Brand">100 visitors to each landing page and at least 20 conversions</a>. This means you need enough visitors to increase your conversion rate. This also means you need enough conversions to generate good results. Without this kind of volume, your split testing will not be worth it. That’s the simple truth.  As you grow your traffic and increase your leads you can decide when the return is worth investing more of your time split testing.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/split-test-calculator/">split test calculator</a>, a sort of cheat sheet, for you to try out. You can approximate traffic and conversion rates and see the results. It will help you decide if split testing is worthwhile.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we heard from Rick Perreault about how <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> started marketing their product before they even developed it. Today, we’re going to dive deeper into some specific tactics he used.</p>
<p><strong>How has personalization played a role in your marketing?</strong></p>
<p>I send a personal email from me, asking for their help so it isn’t just some generic Unbounce company email. It’s coming from me and I kind of lay out why I’m doing this and what I hope to gain out of this. I think our very first survey came from a generic Unbounce email, and we got some response, but we did a personalized one and the response rate was easily doubled.</p>
<p>People were more engaged. I received an email from someone just saying, “Hey, thanks for that personal email. This is awesome, and I love the fact that now I have the CEO’s email!” I was a little scared. I thought, “Oh boy, they’re going to have my email address,” and I thought maybe I’d be overwhelmed with just support questions. That’s only happened once in the last month, so it’s definitely working for us and I’d suggest testing it.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan out your next steps in marketing?</strong></p>
<p>We’re planning things out now, like with an editorial calendar for our blog. When we were in our initial startup mode, it was just about launching the product.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make good content that attracts people to your blog?</strong></p>
<p>We write a lot about best practices. We’ll do reviews of what we think some good landing pages are and of some landing pages that aren’t so good. We tend to focus on conversion rate optimization, but we cover general Internet marketing topics, as well.</p>
<p>Some people think, “Oh yeah, we want to get good search ranks, so we are just going to write all this content, or, you know, stick them on our website.” I’m not sure if that works or not, but I can tell you it’s not going to get shared. People share our content because they find it interesting, informative, and helpful.</p>
<p>I think if it’s not quality content &#8211; if you’re just putting content out for the sake of putting out content &#8211; it won’t get shared. We’ve seen posts that we’ve done when we know it isn’t as good as some of the other ones, and you’ll notice it doesn’t get shared as much. So really trying to make an emphasis to stay focused on creating something that’s of high quality.</p>
<p><strong>What is your approach and mindset as you’re trying to use various marketing channels efficiently?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think our approach had been traditionally a bit more “just get stuff out there.” Now, we’re definitely trying to truly understand what channels are working for us better. Most of what we do is measurable and predictable. But that still leaves us a lot of room to experiment and try new things.</p>
<p>For example, we’re doing a CRO chat every Thursday at 10 am Pacific Time (#CROchat for anyone who’s interested). You don’t know how many people are there paying attention. We don’t know today what kind of impact it will have on our business, but we certainly think it’s worth trying. . . . We’re there, engaged with others who are interested in conversion rate optimization, so it can’t all be bad.</p>

<p>Today, most startups put up landing pages to drum up interest for their as-yet-unbuilt products. Kickstarter campaigns pre-sell gadgets and games while they’re still being prototyped. So I wondered: when is the ideal time to start marketing a product?</p>
<p>I recently polled our followers to find out their answer to this question: before production, during production, or after production. Here are the results:</p>
<p>⅔ of those surveyed said before production.<br />
⅓ of those surveyed said during production.<br />
No one said after production.</p>
<p>It might seem strange to market something that doesn’t even exist yet, but that’s human nature. People are generally very curious. They’re willing to give away their email address to be the first to try something new, even if they have to wait weeks or months for it.</p>
<p>We talked to Rick Perreault from <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> about how they found their first customers. For them, creating great content on the Unbounce blog was their main marketing tool.</p>
<p>“We started marketing the day we started coding,” Perreault says. “We started our blog at the same time we started developing the product. This allowed us to attract people who were interested in conversion-rate optimization and online marketing.”</p>

<p>FeedBurner was this amazing tool that largely sat in the background of many blogs. It kept track of feed stats and email subscribers for blog posts. And no one gave it any thought for a long time, because it just ran properly&#8230;until it stopped. Google has stopped pouring resources into the product &#8212; the FeedBurner <a href="https://twitter.com/FeedBurner/status/228554988127911936">Twitter handle was discontinued</a>, one of their <a href="http://marketingland.com/google-loses-feedburner-jp-domain-the-latest-sign-that-feedburner-is-dying-21153">domains is gone</a>, their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/feedburner-experiencing-stat-issues-api-to-shut-down/">API is going away</a>, and when the product stops working, it <a href="http://marketingland.com/five-days-later-feedburner-restores-feed-counts-22560">doesn’t get fixed for days</a>.</p>

<p>I think bloggers deserve better, but right now, there aren’t free alternatives if you have email subscribers. So, my friends and I have created a <a href="https://launchbit.wufoo.com/forms/want-to-switch-from-feedburner/"><strong>free FeedBurner alternative</strong></a> to address this.</p>
<p>Today, our platform will</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage your email subscribers</li>
<li>Auto-send your new blog posts to your subscribers</li>
</ul>
<p>As we think about how to evolve, we know there are two other things that are important to bloggers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to monetize (often limited opportunities with most email service providers)</li>
<li>Greater distribution of blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>We have some fun plans around both of these, but right now we’re just focused on doing the emailing part right. Currently, our product is in private beta (it doesn’t even have a name!). We’re taking sign ups and are trying to get new users in as quickly as possible. Again, it’s free &#8212; <a href="https://launchbit.wufoo.com/forms/want-to-switch-from-feedburner/">sign up today</a>!</p>
<p>Feel free to email me any questions and feedback (elizabeth [at] launchbit [dot] com).</p>

<p>If you’re like most online startups out there, you’ve probably been told you need a Twitter account. And as a result, read a million articles explaining how to gain followers, tried a handful of strategies, and gotten lackluster results. You’re retweeting, you’re posting pictures, hashtagging and working your butt off just to get an additional two or three measly followers. There’s no magic pill, but here&#8217;s 5 reasons why you might not be maximizing on your work and successes.</p>

<p><strong>1) Stop posting during random hours</strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You might have the most funny, interesting, informative tweet, but if no one sees it when it goes up, you’re not going to get a whole lot of feedback.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/5-reasons-why-you-dont-have-more-twitter-followers/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>If you’re like most online startups out there, you’ve probably been told you need a Twitter account. And as a result, read a million articles explaining how to gain followers, tried a handful of strategies, and gotten lackluster results. You’re retweeting, you’re posting pictures, hashtagging and working your butt off just to get an additional two or three measly followers. There’s no magic pill, but here&#8217;s 5 reasons why you might not be maximizing on your work and successes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Stop posting during random hours</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might have the most funny, interesting, informative tweet, but if no one sees it when it goes up, you’re not going to get a whole lot of feedback. Start posting at <a href="http://socialtimes.com/infographic-reveals-the-best-times-to-post-to-twitter-facebook_b67570" target="_blank">peak Twitter traffic</a> times, and stick to a schedule. Or if you want to go a step further, you can use <a href="http://tweepsmap.com/Map" target="_blank">this tool</a>to check the location of your followers, and find the best tweet time to maximize viewership. It might be tempting to rattle off your “genius” quote or advice at 1am, but do yourself a favor, hold onto it and then fire it off the next day. Because if your writing some great content and nobody sees it, what’s the point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Don’t tweet unless it’s offering value</strong></p>
<p>Far too often, companies or individuals will have a great tweet but then bury it with a bunch of filler, which completely dilutes the quality of your content. Every single one of your tweets should be offering value. What does that mean? It means, post relevant quality content directed at your audience. And if you still aren’t 100% sure who your audience is, get to know them with <a href="http://knowyourfollowers.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a>, which delivers a smorgasbord of information such as your followers age, likes and interests, location, accounts followed.. etc. No one wants to hear about your “worst morning ever” or  how sunny it is outside. So if you aren’t creating tweets that are offering true value, don&#8217;t tweet. Post content that YOU yourself would feel inclined to retweet.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Every single one of your tweets should be offering value (<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=RT:%20@launchbit%20Every%20single%20one%20of%20your%20tweets%20should%20be%20offering%20value%20http://blog.launchbit.com/5-reasons-why-you-dont-have-more-twitter-foll-43822" target="_blank">tweet this</a>)<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=RT:%20@launchbit%20Every%20single%20one%20of%20your%20tweets%20should%20be%20offering%20value%20http://blog.launchbit.com/5-reasons-why-you-dont-have-more-twitter-foll" target="_blank"><br />
</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3) Don’t Abuse Hashtags</strong></p>
<p>All these guides always tell you to get in the conversation by using hashtags. While hashtags are a great way to become part of the universal conversation, especially joining in on newsworthy topics, there is nothing inherently magical about them. So using the tag #mondaymorningchillin has no purpose other than entertainment. If you don’t know what hashtags to use, check out this <a href="http://hashtags.org/" target="_blank">relevant list</a> and if you want to find out the frequency and history of specific hashtags check <a href="http://trendistic.indextank.com/" target="_blank">this out</a>.<strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Stop using hashtags for the sake of using hashtags, there is nothing inherently magical about them (<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=RT:%20@launchbit%20Stop%20using%20hashtags%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20using%20hashtags%2C%20there%20is%20nothing%20inherently%20magical%20about%20them%20http://blog.launchbit.com/5-reasons-why-you-dont-have-more-twitter-foll-43822" target="_blank">tweet this</a>)</em><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= RT:%20@launchbit%20Stop%20using%20hashtags%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20using%20hashtags%2C%20there%20is%20nothing%20inherently%20magical%20about%20them%20http://blog.launchbit.com/5-reasons-why-you-dont-have-more-twitter-followers" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4) Have an informative and interesting bio</strong></p>
<p>No one wants to follow a stranger, in real life or online. So if you don’t already have info about what you do, who you are, what your company is, get that up now. You can have great entertaining tweets, get some retweets and attention, but if you don’t have a bio or compelling tag line explaining who you are, then why would a stranger want to follow you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5) Make your tweets shorter for retweets</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone says retweets are the key to gain new followers, go viral and gain a million trillion followers over night. But for most people, even to get one retweet can be a daunting task. If you want to get closer to the elusive retweet, remember to keep it shorter than usual. Short enough for people to add the RT symbol and your username (“RT @Launchbit”). Launchbit takes up 13 characters, including the space. That means our tweets can be no longer than 127 characters (140–13=127).</p>
