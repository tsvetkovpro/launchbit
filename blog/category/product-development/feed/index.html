<p dir="ltr">An entrepreneur has the busiest job in the world. Between planning the menu, cooking the food and washing the dishes, their responsibilities include absolutely everything.  You can probably relate – I sure can. So it shouldn’t be surprising that one of the most common mistakes an entrepreneur makes is misallocating time and energy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most small business (especially starts-up through mid-sized companies), the focus needs to be on customer growth and increasing top line revenue. Without strong revenue generation and acceleration, a small business can go from profitable to unprofitable in an extremely short period of time. Here is a three-step combo to keep your business on the right track.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test the waters</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before spending your life savings and the next six months of your life on the next big thing, test out the market. Round up your potential customers and determine whether they would actually pay you. Remember…you can’t pay your bills with Facebook “likes”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s pretend I have a great business idea – animal hair dye. I think it’s an excellent idea and spend $10,000 producing 10 different colors and making sure it’s safe to use on animals. After 6 months of hard work, the product is ready to use and I’ve even tested it on a few different animals.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RUiKiHloE9ZJeNR59DU4e1qCNp9TFQq6Q_cgRHZzhzAuVAp2Z_n-K-Cv5KbWIwZplrsl-hPT00oKnQA3KiUv_ZVWwxE2qnW2rlnVV9YHvpP8HI7jHwDl7FDSyw" alt="" width="492px;" height="256px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">I set the date for the grand opening and eagerly wait for it to arrive. The day comes and…no one shows up! What a disaster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s see how this could have been avoided. Something as simple as a landing page can help you gauge interest and determine whether you have a viable business plan. An ideal landing page will help you collect email addresses and build up some hype so there’s a line waiting in front of your store when you launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cater to each potential customer</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s face it, we all like to feel like we’re special. But it’s true &#8211; the more a customer can relate to you, the greater chance you have of converting them. But what if you only have one product and you’re trying to market to multiple market segments?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back to our example. The animal dye idea didn’t work out, but perhaps a pet shampoo product will be profitable. This time I create a landing page and receive enough interest to warrant creating the pet shampoo. After another 6 months of hard work, I finish creating my product and name it Super-Poo 5000. It’s absolutely the best shampoo on the market for dogs, cat, hamsters, and parrots. Now comes time to market it. If you throw up a website and market to all of them at once, dog owners won’t want it since cats are involved, cat owners won’t want it since hamsters are involved, hamster owners don’t want it because….etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What you want to do is cater to each individual pet owner. So if I were running an email ad campaign on LaunchBit that focuses on dog owners, I would create an individual landing page dedicated for dog owners that speaks to the specifics of how the shampoo helps with something like dog grooming. Same for the cats, hamsters and parrots.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Focus on time-allocation</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In finance, the term “capital-allocation” refers to how to efficiently invest available resources. Let’s say you have $100 to invest between Project A and Project B. Both projects cost $100, and everything is the same except Project A expects to return 5% and Project B expects to return 8%. Obviously Project B is favorable. But in an otherwise similar comparison, entrepreneurs often make the same mistake with their time. I call this poor time allocation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t focus on menial tasks that don’t have a lasting impact on revenue. Focus on those that do. Instead of spending 20 hours debating what color your logo should be, hire a designer to come in for an hour or two – it’ll be cheaper and will look better. Leverage your strengths and outsource everything else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A service provider like <a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/?utm_source=LaunchBit&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=jc">KickoffLabs </a>can help you create multiple landing pages to test your markets, generate leads, and cater to individual customers.

<p><a href="http://cardinalblue.com/">Cardinal Blue</a> saw this trend firsthand, publishing a few apps to iTunes that didn’t get amazing traction. But then they created <a href="http://pic-collage.com/">PicCollage</a>, a photo app that grew to 14 million downloads and 5.3 million active users.</p>
<p>In this interview with cofounder Ching-Mei Chen, she tells us about how they optimized for the app store, what factors affect your ranking, and why you should update often.</p>
<p><strong>What happened on day one? Did you do any marketing?</strong></p>
<p>We were shocked to be featured as new and noteworthy by Apple. We didn&#8217;t talk to anyone from Apple or the press. We can only guess it was picked up because of its simplicity and that it showed off the touch interface. Back then you could only pool multiple photos into one area of the screen, but it had no other features like saving a collage or sharing it. Apple likes simplicity, I think. It was so simple, it couldn&#8217;t be poorly designed.</p>
<p>It only got featured for one week and got bumped up into the top 10 of photo apps; and now it&#8217;s been 18 months and we haven&#8217;t been knocked out of the top 20 since. The competition is getting crazy, and we haven&#8217;t spent any marketing money yet.</p>
<p><strong>After being featured, what did you do to maintain that growth?</strong></p>
<p>I think a big part of it is user experience – being bug free, and the user knowing what to do within the first five seconds. That&#8217;s why our interface is really simple, and the motions are really intuitive. One thing that definitely makes a difference is SEO. We use different terms every version to see which work best.</p>
<p><strong>What are you altering?</strong></p>
<p>They scrape descriptions, and the reviews. We change the description&#8217;s keywords. There&#8217;s also keyword search terms that you can change with each revision. We tried keywords like “Justin Bieber,” too, and we scored pretty high, actually. The only other variables are the screenshots. You have to make sure people love you, and write good reviews for you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you prompt people to write reviews?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but we have to avoid being spammy. Every third time an active user comes into the app, we ask them to leave a review. The other thing we did – I think the way we phrase it is “Do you love PicCollage?” and they&#8217;re asked to either write a review saying how they love it, or write feedback on what to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Does Apple check for relevancy in keywords?</strong></p>
<p>No. Only titles, and if someone complains. Apparently, now, you can&#8217;t put the name of another app in your title. Also, if your icon is too similar and someone complains. Also, if it infringes copyright, or if it&#8217;s an obvious direct copy of another program, it gets taken out.</p>
<p><strong>How often did you publish updates?</strong></p>
<p>We had a newer version in the queue immediately as Apple released the previous version, so about one-week development cycles. That&#8217;s not how we do it now because the program is code-wise a lot more complicated, with more menus, etc. We kind of lost sight of the big picture as we were trying to turn out things we needed to get in there as soon as possible, like sharing and saving. Trying to figure out a roadmap for the product took more time. Now we generally have two submissions per month. We were initially advised to not put out too many updates, but I think it keeps the program fresh in users&#8217; minds and makes it look like it&#8217;s being maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Does updating boost your visibility in the store?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. Each update resets your stars to the all-time average, but you can still read previous reviews. Currently we have five stars, but if we pushed out a new version, it would go back to 4.5 stars. As we get more reviews, it goes back to that 4.5-star equilibrium anyway.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://pic-collage.com/">PicCollage</a> is now available on iOS and Android platforms. If you haven’t tried it out, you should definitely download it. It’s easy to use, and a fun way to create picture collages!</em></p>

<p>You’re a little bit nervous.  You’re spending all this time putting together a great marketing campaign, but since you’re a startup, your product is not completely finished or optimized yet.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><br />
</strong>Let me share 3 tips for using marketing to drive interactions with your development team:<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><br />
1) Set priorities and communicate very clearly</strong></p>
<p>I know you’ve got a lot of ideas &#8211; that’s what you get paid the big bucks for.  But when talking with your team, you need to be very clear about what is important to you right now.  And, be clear about which specific parts of a feature are most important in the first version, and which parts can wait until later.  Don’t just do this verbally.  A simple bullet point list, ordered by priority, on a single page of paper will do.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LDGjXkSPdjmFvOkbV7nmM0FT9bgfhRAE58R8mLz6-GiWTNac95W03Ix-z2geSqJXg9e7-FXWkiW9JIeaUXW5tBfjmBXMyV9lVoxNEAXHqB_VOwLOWNhL" alt="" width="500px;" height="167px;" /><br />
</strong><em>Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smemon/5076178739/sizes/m/in/photostream/">Sean MacEntee</a></em><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"></strong></p>
<p>If a feature is not important to you right now, then don’t talk about it.  At all.  You can list it on your team’s backlog (aka “to-do list”), but don’t get knee-deep in detailed discussions with anyone about it, or you will distract them from the things you need sooner.  Communicate very clearly about what you need done in the short term and exactly the required minimal features for it to work.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><br />
2) Be flexible</strong></p>
<p>In any project, there are three sides to the “iron triangle”: Budget, Timeline, and Scope.  Budgets, if they exist at all, are always tight at a startup.  If you have a fixed timeline (“we have to have this new feature before the tradeshow!”), then you need to be flexible about the features that can be completed in time.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fJgxYnZFKF8JlpqsB0smK9i2dcD_k_ehQJ250YqMQUbTwJCbmxeG6h5Qjlik7FrHGr5KppvC-wViUXLbSQdbnLObl2uQExrDq4FPOW-iLrVVZB4UQRIv" alt="" width="500px;" height="364px;" /></strong></p>
<p><em>Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecogh/6152250977/sizes/m/in/photostream/">mikecogh</a></em><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"></strong></p>
<p>3) Be willing to reinvest in permanent features</p>
<p>If your team is following Customer Development or Lean Startup methodologies (and you probably should), that means that you are building lots of small pieces and testing them with your customers (these are called experiments).  You build out a simple idea, and get it in front of customers as quickly as possible.<br />
<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><br />
</strong>If they don’t like it, you need to be willing to throw it away and move on to the next idea.  Equally important, though, is what to do if customers do like the new feature.  You can speed up the deployment of these experiments by encouraging your developers to deploy messier code as part of an experiment, because you don’t know if users will like the feature anyway.  But if they do like it, you need to be willing to give your development team time to improve (or in many cases redo) code before it becomes a permanent part of the system.  This approach will allow you to deploy more experiments more quickly.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7349731740541756"><br />

<p>If you communicate your priorities and deadlines clearly, are flexible in scope, and you’re up front with your team about what you can compromise on, then you are helping your development team to help you.  And anything you can do to empower your software development teams to deliver code faster is a good thing.<br />

<p>I&#8217;ve read a lot of business books over the years &#8212; for school, for *fun*, for work.  Most of them are just ok &#8212; largely intuitive and too high level to be useful.  I wouldn&#8217;t recommend most books I&#8217;ve read to anyone.  But, I just finished reading a draft of Eric Ries&#8217; new book, <em><a href="http://lean.st/launchbit">The Lean Startup</a></em>.  This is a must read for all internet entrepreneurs and a compelling read for anyone who&#8217;s ever wanted to cut waste out of new projects&#8230;including stuffing envelopes!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read a lot of business books over the years &#8212; for school, for *fun*, for work.  Most of them are just ok &#8212; largely intuitive and too high level to be useful.  I wouldn&#8217;t recommend most books I&#8217;ve read to anyone.  But, I just finished reading a draft of Eric Ries&#8217; new book, <em><a href="http://lean.st/launchbit">The Lean Startup</a></em>.  This is a must read for all internet entrepreneurs and a compelling read for anyone who&#8217;s ever wanted to cut waste out of new projects&#8230;including stuffing envelopes!</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Ries&#8217; work</a>, this book is focused on reducing &#8220;business waste,&#8221; the time, money, and resources that companies spend building things people don&#8217;t want.  Ries discusses how we can reduce this waste through his business philosophy, the Lean Startup Method, which is largely an amalgam of ideas from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Software Development</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way">Toyota Way</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gary_Blank">Steve Blank&#8217;s customer development</a> philosophy.  In short, the Lean Startup Method calls for doing iterations of small batches of work combined with careful measurement.  By doing rapid iterations of work and measurement, he talks about how companies can then make quick decisions to change the path they&#8217;re going down, which is critical if it&#8217;s the wrong one.  Long-term business planning and projections don&#8217;t work for new initiatives, because there are so many unknowns.  This kind of continuous learning and iteration is precisely what new product/project teams need, regardless of whether they&#8217;re at a large company or tinkering in a garage.</p>
<p>Although the book addresses a very heavy and complex topic, it&#8217;s a surprisingly light read and appeals to broad audiences.  The book doesn&#8217;t use technical terminology or complex business words, so you don&#8217;t have to be a developer or a finance whiz to be able to understand this book.  In fact, this book review uses more terminology than the book itself&#8230; <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Case studies</strong></p>
<p>The case studies included in <em>The Lean Startup </em>are fascinating.  Even those who are well-versed with the Lean Startup Methodology already will find new examples &#8212; I certainly did.  He talks about IMVU, the company he founded, in much greater depth and shares other stories that are largely unknown.  His examples range from well known tech companies to small startups.  What I like best is that he&#8217;s able to get data from a couple of real companies and dive into a thorough analysis.  His best case studies are of internet companies, so this is particularly appealing to those who are in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong></p>
<p>Ries dives into more specifics around how to measure your results.  He talks about how internet companies often become inadvertantly misled through commonly used vanity metrics: number of users, revenue, etc.  But, just because your total number of users and total revenue is growing doesn&#8217;t mean you are doing better.</p>
<p>For example, if you have 100 people coming to your site today and 10 people sign up, your conversion rate is 10%.  If tomorrow you have 100 people coming to your site and only 5 people sign up, your conversion rate has dropped to 5%.  If on the subsequent days, you have 100 people coming to your site and &lt; 3 people sign up on each day, your conversion rate has dropped to 3% or lower.  By dissecting it like this, we can see that our conversion rate is actually dropping &#8212; we&#8217;re doing worse.  But, looking at these same numbers using conventional metrics, we might actually think we&#8217;re doing well.  Afterall, everyday, we&#8217;re increasing the number of people from 10 signups to 15 to 18 in total etc&#8230;  We might celebrate our growing user base even though we&#8217;re actually doing worse.</p>
<p>This is obviously a simple example, but in real-life, PR and random spikes of traffic can mask your true performance without a well-thought out dashboard.  Many startups or new product teams are too busy working on their initiatives to concern themselves with setting up their funnels and dashboard correctly.  Ries talks about how you can set up your dashboard to make sure you are looking at legitimate numbers.  Here at <a href="launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, prior to reading Ries&#8217; book, we spent a lot of time thinking about how to set up our dashboard, but after reading this book, even we realized that we needed to make a couple of changes in the way we think about some of our numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Last Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the final book will be like &#8212; I sent him a bunch of feedback related to organization and writing.  But that said, even in its draft state, I can tell you that Ries is a good writer.  He&#8217;s not a professional writer, but he gets his points across through pretty good storytelling.  The content and topic is very solid and makes it worthwhile to buy <em><a href="http://lean.st/launchbit">The Lean Startup</a></em>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Keyword searches are a great way to learn about how your potential customers are thinking about solving their problems.  Many web marketers do keyword searches to scale their businesses via search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM).  However, we&#8217;re going to talk about keyword searches for a different purpose &#8212; for market research.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Before starting a web business, we want to know how to think about the landscape of a size given market &#8212; there are a number of techniques to do this research, and keyword research is just a small part of this research process.  However, it&#8217;s one of the more overlooked methods.  We&#8217;ll want to do keyword searches to learn about problems people are facing, current solutions, alternatives, and competitor presence.  We&#8217;ll look at this from two angles &#8212; searching for problems and searching for solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Finding Pain Points</strong></span></p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ll want to find out what pain points people are searching for online.  <span style="font-size: small;">For example, suppose we are thinking about starting a web business around an online exercise motivation tool &#8212; we&#8217;ll call it Naggy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To get a sense of the scope of the problem, we&#8217;ll want to know how many people per month are looking for words and phrases related to exercise motivation.  <a href="http://guide.launchbit.com/link/adwordskeyword/">Google AdWords Keyword Tool</a> is a great free tool that tells you how many times a particular phrase or related phrase is on average searched for in a given month via the Google Search Engine.  By experimenting with various phrases, using this tool, we find  there are 1000 monthly local searches for the phrase &#8220;How to get motivated to exercise.&#8221; By searching for phrases in just 3 min, we find there are plenty of other related &#8220;pain point phrases&#8221; that are searched for thousands of times per month, so this is a promising sign.  You&#8217;ll probably do lots of mad searching, but for <a href="guide.launchbit.com">LaunchBit Startup Guide</a> users, make sure to save the &#8220;best phrases.&#8221;  At this stage, we usually sort our phrases by search volume and divide the list into thirds.  We&#8217;ll save the middle-third set of phrases.  These phrases tend to be both promising in terms of search volume but also generally have less competition than the top third, which will be relevant later for when we in take out ads (another topic for another blog post).  Also, the top third of keywords tend to be more generic, but we really want to use more specific keywords to get as targeted of an audience as possible.  </span></p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at competition.  We want to know who else is offering a solution to this problem, and we also want to know what keywords those competitor sites are optimized for.  We can start by doing a Google search to find domains who rank high for the key phrases we saved from the Google AdWords Keyword Tool.  We can take some of these top domains and search for them in <a href="http://guide.launchbit.com/link/semrush/">SEMRush</a>, a freemium product, to figure out what keyword phrases those sites are optimized for.  Then, we can revise our Google AdWords Keyword search to see what other phrases may be relevant that we had originally missed. Note: if you are not paying for this tool, they limit you to 10 searches per day with a registered free account.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So now we&#8217;ve found the scope of the problem and some top competitors and their keywords.  Lastly, we&#8217;ll want to understand if there&#8217;s an underserved opportunity and get a sense of how many sites are trying to compete in this niche.  To better understand this, we pay for and use <a href="http://guide.launchbit.com/link/wordtracker/">WordTracker Pro</a>, but they also have a 7-day free trial.  Using WordTracker, we&#8217;ll search for the </span><span style="font-size: small;">same saved keywords and phrases.  WordTracker gives us the number called &#8220;Google Count,&#8221; which tells us how many sites are trying to get your potential customers&#8217; attention.  The Competition (IAAT) tells us how many sites have a particular keyword or phrase in their title tags and anchor text.  This indicates the number of sites that are going directly after that specific keyword phrase.  To make this easier to understand, WordTracker has created a metric called a KEI, which is essentially the ratio between the search volume and the IAAT number.  The math behind this is another topic in itself, but in essence, the KEI explains how </span><span style="font-size: small;">underserved the opportunity is.  The larger the number, the greater the opportunity to &#8220;capture&#8221; this keyword phrase.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Scoping out Competitive Solutions and Alternatives</strong></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;d want to repeat this exercise with these same three keyword tools.  This time, we&#8217;d look for current solutions and alternatives.  For Naggy, we&#8217;d probably want to search for phrases like &#8220;kettlebell workout&#8221; or &#8220;online personal trainer&#8221;<em>.</em></p>
<p>From personal experience, keyword research is great way to scope out the landscape of your potential market using a bottoms-up market sizing approach.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">When Elizabeth and I launched <a href="http://www.shinyorb.com">Shiny Orb</a>, a comparison shopping site for wedding apparel, we had thousands of dresses. So, it was a no-brainer we needed search to help people hone in on the perfect dress.  We created an attribute search that allowed people to search by length, neckline, and strap styles as well as price and later by color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">This past summer, we started <a href="http://www.dressmob.com">DressMob</a>, a social shopping site for dresses. The selection on DressMob would be even bigger, so we wanted to create a better search. We decided to draw from usability on Shiny Orb as an initial starting point for building this search on DressMob, so we had a number of considerations:  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><strong>How big should the search box be? </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">On Shiny Orb, we have a drop down menu allowing people to show 20, 40, 65, 100 results. We used <a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> to determine the percentage of people selecting each dropdown choice and found that almost everyone would either not change the default selection (20) OR would select to see the maximum number of results they could choose (100). Initially, our maximum number was 64, but over the course of weeks, we kept increasing the maximum number, and each week, we found the new maximum option would always be popular. Although with A/B testing can never give us a rationale for why people undertake certain actions, we think that people either kept the default setting or liked to<em> </em>see as many products as possible on a single page.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><strong>How should we prioritize the search filters?<br />
</strong><br />
On Shiny Orb, we added a price slider as a search filter, because we loved using this kind of price slider on other great AJAX sites. But, to our techie dismay, people just didn&#8217;t use it on Shiny Orb. </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">We did find, though, that some of our most qualified Shiny Orb users came to the site via a link on our homepage that advertised for &#8220;bridesmaid dresses under $100&#8243;. We also found that people loved using the color and dress-length filters, and found that few people used the neckline and sleeves filters. We ran a number of e</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">xperiments on Shiny Orb in changing the positioning of the filters to ensure that position wasn&#8217;t a factor in usage. We found that we could increase usage of a given filter by a couple of percentage points by placing it up towards the top of the search interface, but </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">no re-arrangement we experimented with dramatically changed filter usage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><strong>Are there other search designs that could be better?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><strong> </strong>On Shiny Orb, we allowed people to select multiple options for a given filter </span><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">(e.g. could select both floor length and cocktail length dresses). We used </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><a href="http://google.com/websiteoptimizer/">Google Website Optimizer</a> on Shiny Orb to see if people would behave differently if shown a single style of dresses vs. all styles at once. We found that our conversions did not change. People who were going to use the search used it regardless, and from that we concluded that it would be just fine to show a single style at a time.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">This allowed ourselves to explore two dramatically different search mechanisms for DressMob. Our first idea consisted of a group of drop-down menus that formed a sentence of what you were looking for (see image 2). This meant that you would only be able to select one choice for each filter. Using tools like NavFlow by <a href="http://www.usabilityhub.com">UsabilityHub</a>, we tested if people would find this search user interface easy to use. The results were good, though, several people commented on how it was hard to read the sentence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">Our second idea was reminiscent of a visual search, and with this idea, we allowed users to select the neck, sleeve, and length styles on a &#8220;doll-like image&#8221; (see image 3). We felt this &#8220;doll&#8221; idea was a little more cool and unique than what we currently had on Shiny Orb, and it kept the search interface real estate small.  We tested many iterations on NavFlow and through user studies: without helper text on the doll (people were confused), with helper text (cluttered), sliding detailed information in and out (made the doll look decapitated), sliding out the entire doll (took up lots of space, hard to see the products), etc. None these options sat well with us, personally, and our task completion rate on NavFlow wasn&#8217;t great either. Turns out as much as we loved how this looked, it was not an intuitive search interface.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><strong>Culmination?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">In the end, we went with a search that was very familiar. We found the usability of a regular checkbox search to be much higher, probably because users were already comfortable and familiar with this type of search. (see image 1 for the end result)</span> W<span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">e decided to maximize space for product results and minimize real estate for the search interface. </span>We removed the price slider but put in some of Shiny Orb&#8217;s most popular price categories. We moved the color search to the top where it could be more easily accessed. We decided to just show length attribute choices by default but hide neck and sleeve selections to optimize the search interface for most people.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">You can learn a lot about ease-of-use, clarity, and usability just by talking to people and showing them pictures. Whether you meet people in person, chat with them by email, or even show them to strangers through tools like NavFlow, it&#8217;s certainly worth figuring out the difficulties of a user interface before you start building it.</span></p>
