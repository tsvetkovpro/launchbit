So, if you decide to read further it means you’ve determined that you have enough visitors on your landing pages to justify your time split testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5603" title="jump" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jump1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’ve decided to take the leap and think split testing is worth your time. Ok, so where do you start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We all know what to split test</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you want to split test whatever will guide your traffic to your call-to-action. Most marketers like to make adjustments to the most important elements – like form length, headline, and call-to-action – because they have the most impact on whether your traffic will convert or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m here to tell you that headlines are THE MOST important element to split test</strong>, and thus, that is where you should start. The headline is the most important thing that you can split test because it is<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/"> the first “gateway”</a> that your readers have to pass through. On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only <a href="http://mediacorpus.com/truth-8020-rule/">2 out of 10 will read the rest</a>. This means that you will lose more people at the headline than anywhere else on the page, so test the headline first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it’s the first thing that your visitors will read, the headline of your landing page offers the biggest opportunity for improvements in conversion rate. Make it compelling, because<a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html"> you only have 0-8 seconds</a> to make an impression on your visitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You still think headlines aren’t THAT important?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you heard the story about advertising legend David Ogilvy, who rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement <strong>104 times</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5623" title="Rolls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rolls.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is someone who clearly understood the power of headlines, and how the headline literally determined whether his content would get read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here another example. Adam Mordecai of Upworthy (formerly The Onion) says that he writes<a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"> 25 headlines for every post</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Upworthy-1/What-tools-does-Upworthy-employ-to-test-its-headlines"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5622" title="blue text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blue-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, writing a great headline doesn’t guarantee success, but the better your headline, the better your chances of getting your content read and your visitors taking action. The benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied with your offer on the rest of your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every marketer would love to see an increase in clicks or conversions and we know that headlines have a BIG impact in making this happen.  Still, many many many b2b marketers underestimate just how important headlines are and how they can make a difference in getting more eyes on your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are a big deal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why, again?</strong> Because it’s the first thing people will see. Not the text copy, not the form, not even the call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-write-headlines/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5621" title="KISSmetrics text" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KISSmetrics-text.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s the takeaway?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Headlines are the MOST important landing page element to split test because they are what compel visitors to click, or read, or share, or convert. So spend considerable time writing your headlines and split testing to improve them. Many marketers spend A LOT of time testing various elements of their landing pages (<em>button colors are overrated</em>), but then just put any old headline at the top without realizing that in doing so they might not be ensuring that they are actually persuading their visitors to convert.</p>

<p><em>Image credit: b2bsecrets.com</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">This scenario happens quite often and leaves a lot of b2b marketers with a decision to make. To split test or not to split test. We all know what split testing is and that it can surely improve landing page results if it’s done correctly, but how many of us have actually tried it and received results we could take action with? I’m guessing not many. Even if you&#8217;ve been thinking about split testing for a while, you might be wondering just exactly how much time you should spend on it?</p>
<p>The answer really depends on the size of your company – how many employees you have to put time into it, how much you have to pay for it, and how much traffic you receive to your landing page on a monthly basis. The more of these things you have, the more practical split testing will be. The less of these things, the less time and energy you should put into testing. Let’s expand on the most important of these things &#8211; traffic. You first need to make sure you have enough visitors going to your landing pages that will give you significant results during your split tests.</p>
<p><strong>So how many visitors are enough?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To get good numbers in your split testing efforts that will actually have an impact on your conversion rates, you should have a minimum of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=brand&amp;utm_campaign=G_WW_Search_Brand">100 visitors to each landing page and at least 20 conversions</a>. This means you need enough visitors to increase your conversion rate. This also means you need enough conversions to generate good results. Without this kind of volume, your split testing will not be worth it. That’s the simple truth.  As you grow your traffic and increase your leads you can decide when the return is worth investing more of your time split testing.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/infographic/split-test-calculator/">split test calculator</a>, a sort of cheat sheet, for you to try out. You can approximate traffic and conversion rates and see the results. It will help you decide if split testing is worthwhile.</p>

<p>MixRank is a platform that allows you to spy on your competitor&#8217;s ad campaigns. It was founded in 2011 by Ilya Lichtenstein and is backed by Y Combinator, 500 Startups, Mark Cuban, and other angel investors.  They did a couple of interviews with Startup Frontier on <a href="http://www.startupfrontier.com/2012/09/mixrank-getting-customers-before-building/" target="_blank">getting customers before building their product</a> and <a href="http://www.startupfrontier.com/2012/10/mixrank-doing-paid-advertising-effectively/" target="_blank">doing paid advertising effectively</a>. While most startups have a difficult time trying to get their first customers, MixRank knew how to grow an audience before building a product.  And, they <a href="https://angel.co/mixrank" target="_blank">grew their revenue 44%</a> per week when their product became ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MixRankDet.jpg"><img src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MixRankDet-250x200.jpg" alt="mix-rank" title="MixRankDet" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4678" /></a></p>

<p><small><i>Image by <a href="http://www.orissajenkins.com">Orissa Jenkins</a></i></small></p>
<p><strong>1. Segmenting their audience</strong></p>
<p>By segmenting their audience, MixRank was able to drill down to get a very well-defined group. This helped narrow the scope of the problem they were trying to solve.</p>
<p><strong>2. Paying for market research</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Right away, MixRank started spending $2,000 per month on Google Adwords. They viewed it not as a risk, but as a way to learn what people wanted. In addition, it helped them determine their costs for customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creating content their audience will respond to</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having narrowed their focus, MixRank was able to select content that would engage their target audience. Whether it was trying to break news, reach out to bloggers, or post on a social bookmarking site, they would include a sign up invitation for lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Offering free services</strong></p>
<p>Spending $2k/mo (of money that was tough to come by) and offering free services doesn&#8217;t sound like a great business plan. However, these were the strategies MixRank used to gain valuable insight on the market. Specifically, they built marketing campaigns and did free consulting for people willing to talk to them so they could figure out exactly what their problems were. In addition, they now had a list of people that &#8216;owed them a favor&#8217; and who were more likely to be responsive to requests later on. All it cost them was time, which was something they had a lot more of than money!</p>
<p><strong>5. Being patient</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MixRank didn&#8217;t dismiss campaigns that didn&#8217;t yield immediate results. Particularly for Saas products, potential customers need time to play with it before deciding to buy. They use, as a rule of thumb, to get at least 30 conversions before determining what the conversion rate for the campaign is.</p>
<p><strong>6. Running Facebook ads</strong></p>
<p>Remember the $2k/mo on Google Adwords? It&#8217;s difficult to keep going at that pace, especially for B2B/Saas businesses. There&#8217;s typically not thousands of keywords to bid on and competing against big enterprise software companies that are spending millions tend to be fruitless. With Facebook ads, it is easier to drill down to the target audience and the competition was/is generally local small businesses making it less competitive (at the time).</p>
<p><strong>7. Sponsoring a blog</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MixRank did sponsored reviews with bloggers for sales leads, offering $2 or $3 for every sign up. Of course, there was transparency and full disclosure, but the risk was low for both parties. The risk for MixRank was whether the sign up would lead to revenue. For bloggers, they didn&#8217;t need to bet on, for example, making more money with this ad versus another, because this piece of content was a post not a banner ad.  As a bonus, sponsored reviews show up near the top in search engines, compelling bloggers to do a sponsored post.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sponsoring email newsletters</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Newsletters provided MixRank with a burst of traffic really quickly. It was also high quality traffic for lead generation, as newsletter subscribers are an audience that is willing to give up their email address for the right content or product.</p>
<p>Try out some of these steps to improve your lead generation and reach your target audience to help grow your revenue.</p>

<p>I’m a huge productivity junky – I feel there’s often too much wasted time in business. Here are some tips I use that may be helpful for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use third-party tools to stay organized.</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of productivity tools, and I love hearing about new ones. But the one that I absolutely rely on is <a href="http://www.followup.cc/">Followup.cc</a>. It’s a gem: it simply provides me with reminders when I need to follow up with people. I use this for sales and for networking so that I never have to worry about bogging down my calendar with reminders of whom to follow up with and when &#8212; Followup.cc reminds me.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/4-productivity-tips-for-internet-startups/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>I’m a huge productivity junky – I feel there’s often too much wasted time in business. Here are some tips I use that may be helpful for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use third-party tools to stay organized.</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of productivity tools, and I love hearing about new ones. But the one that I absolutely rely on is <a href="http://www.followup.cc/">Followup.cc</a>. It’s a gem: it simply provides me with reminders when I need to follow up with people. I use this for sales and for networking so that I never have to worry about bogging down my calendar with reminders of whom to follow up with and when &#8212; Followup.cc reminds me. It’s not a plugin, so it runs quickly and simply.</p>
<p><strong>2. Outsource non-core activities.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of companies have non-core tasks. It could be research. It could be categorization. It could be developing internal tools or an intranet. Bottom line is that we all have non-core activities that need to get done, but they should be done by someone else so that you can focus on what is core to the business.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is also liquid labor. You can add and subtract resources as you need them by creating project-based contracts or by using <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is key to your company’s growth, but we’ve all heard the horror stories about it. Yes, there’s a chance that you may outsource to people who do tasks about 50-80% as well as you expect them to. But, that’s OK. You’re outsourcing non-core activities. Let’s take a concrete example: at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, we run an ad network. We have publishers who want to monetize and advertisers who want to get more sales. The core of our business lies in making sure we get the right advertisers and publishers and that both parties are happy. That’s it. Everything else is non-core. Legal, accounting, payroll – all of those are obviously non-core. But less obvious, researching new potential advertisers and publishers are also non-core activities. So, we outsource that, too. Sure, our researchers might miss listing some really awesome publishers and advertisers. Their Google-searching skills might not be as good as mine or their motivation may not be as high as mine. But at the end of the day, it’s just not worth my time to deal with the few that they miss, since our core business is in keeping our existing advertisers and publishers happy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Plan work for on the go.</strong></p>
<p>In high school, I noticed that a few basketball teammates would always manage to get a lot of homework done in the time between our games and practices, while everyone else on the team would chit-chat in the gym. Since I didn’t want to stay up late doing homework, I tried to emulate them. I found that for me, there were only certain types of homework that I could effectively do on the go. So, I would save those types of homework to do around our games and practices.</p>
<p>These days are no different. I spend hours here and there on transportation (buses, trains, planes, and cars). And hours here and there waiting for meetings and appointments. Over all these channels, there can be so much wasted time. So, I save specific kinds of activities for these times: blog posts, like this one. Or long emails, reports, or presentations.</p>
<p><strong>4. Sleep.</strong></p>
<p>When I was in school, the smartest kids in my classes were never those who stayed up a lot or pulled all-nighters. The smartest ones were the people who worked the most efficiently and got rest. This goes without saying, the same applies to working. But in the startup world, I’ve found that a lot of entrepreneurs tout their lack of sleep as a badge of honor. Heck, I used to do that. <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a>, a mobile app backend startup, even went as far as to make <a href="http://twitter.yfrog.com/kgxu4twj">t-shirts</a> that say “There is no sleep in hustle” for themselves. Anyway, I have since realized that with sleep, I make fewer mistakes, think more quickly, and come up with more creative solutions to do things in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>These are just a few things that I do. What do you do to stay productive? Which tools do you rely on to help you stay ahead of the curve? Help us expand the list!</p>

<p>By Elizabeth</p>
<p>Last week, I attended 500Startups&#8217; <a href="http://unsexy.co/">Unsexy Conference</a>.  It was seriously one of the best conferences that I&#8217;ve ever attended, packed with great information.  Here are my notes from just a handful of talks that I was able to attend and found interesting:</p>
<p>Steven Boal, CEO of <a href="http://www.coupons.com">coupons.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 70% of Americans purchased the Sunday paper in 1998.  Today, the Sunday paper reaches &#60; 40%.  Crazy drop.</li>
<li>Many people used to buy the Sunday paper just for the coupons.  These days his business is booming due to this trend.</li>
<li>When he launched his company in the 90s, he only had one coupon on his site!(and they had massive press)</li>
<li>They make money per coupon used.</li>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/tidbits-from-the-unsexy-conference/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></ul>

<p>Steven Boal, CEO of <a href="http://www.coupons.com">coupons.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 70% of Americans purchased the Sunday paper in 1998.  Today, the Sunday paper reaches &lt; 40%.  Crazy drop.</li>
<li>Many people used to buy the Sunday paper just for the coupons.  These days his business is booming due to this trend.</li>
<li>When he launched his company in the 90s, he only had one coupon on his site!(and they had massive press)</li>
<li>They make money per coupon used.  Also make money from data collection &#8212; if you buy diapers, you&#8217;re likely to buy a minivan.  There&#8217;s a lot of correlation across purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rashmi Sinha, CEO of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net">slideshare.net</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the beginning, people used slideshare to make it easy to share presentations (via one link) with others; these days, people use slideshare to get their presentations discovered.</li>
<li>Overall, vanity is a big component of how the site works.  People love to look at how many views their presentations receive.  When the slideshare team added an extra couple of zeros to these numbers on April Fool&#8217;s Day and emailed everyone telling them they were a rockstar, at first people were excited.  But then, they got mad when they learned they&#8217;d been tricked, because they&#8217;d told their superiors they&#8217;d done so well in spreading their presentations.  This is how the team learned that a lot of businesses/consultants were using slideshare.</li>
<li>People love being featured on the homepage and will share this with their friends and followers in excitement, driving more traffic to slideshare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ben Chestnut, CEO of <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused on design as a competitive advantage.  They used to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on Google AdWords, but then they noticed that the cost per acquired user was the same cost as giving out MailChimp apparel.  So, now they try to do more fun customer acquisition with their gear.  They also have a fun user interface.</li>
<li>Moving to freemium has given them hockey stick growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Michelle Broderick, Marketing/Strategy/Culture at <a href="http://www.uber.com">Uber</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want your customers to be genuine groupies and fans of your product/service.  To do this, you have to figure out what your company stands for &#8212; what is genuine to the founders, the brand, and your users?</li>
<li>For Yelp, at a high level, they provide users with an easy way to experience a place.  So, at a crowded event, they drove in an RV and provided attendees with a free place to do online searches with Yelpers standing by to make reservations.</li>
<li>At Uber, they provide users with a way to buy on-demand services.   So they&#8217;ve run marketing campaigns from on-demand Mariachi bands to on-demand ice cream, where you can use Uber to get those services to come to you so you can buy ice cream or music.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the conference, we also announced the <a href="http://www.newsletterdirectory.co/apply-api/">launch of our new text API</a>, which allows  publishers to get beautiful text ads in their email digests.</p>
<p>I look forward to attending another <a href="http://500.co">500Startups</a> conference in the near future.  Maybe I&#8217;ll see you at <a href="http://inboxlove.com/">InboxLove</a>?</p>

<p>Wow, time has flown!  I just noticed the date on the calendar &#8212; it&#8217;s been over 1 year since we released the first iteration of <a title="LaunchBit" href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, which at the time was simply a service that helped advertisers manually place ads in a variety of relevant newsletters.   No technology, just a test of demand.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve come a long ways since our days in the <a href="http://500.co">500Startups</a> accelerator program.  We&#8217;ve built out a cost-per-click auction system, dashboards, and a number of algorithms for  fraud checking and ad targeting.   We&#8217;ve worked with fantastic publishers and advertisers, who have helped us get better with constant feedback and patience.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/happy-belated-1st-birthday-launchbit/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m pleased to announce a new group of partners who are helping us get to where we want to go.  We&#8217;ve raised a seed round of funding from a number of people whose work I&#8217;ve long admired: investors 500Startups, VegasTech Fund (Tony Hsieh et al), TriplePoint Capital, Bruno Bowden (ex-Google) as well as entrepreneurs Andrew Chen, David Hauser (Grasshopper Group), Siamak Taghaddos (Grasshopper Group), Yee Lee (One Jackson, Katango), Srini Panguluri (Tagstand, Project Wedding), Omar Seyal (Tagstand), among other close supporters.  I&#8217;m also super excited to be working with our advisors Andrew Chen and Philip Kaplan (aka Pud).</p>
<p>But, all of this is just the beginning.  We have a lot of work to do.  So, let&#8217;s go!</p>

<p>Making our first full-time hire was really nerve-wracking.  Finding someone really sharp AND would fit in super well was going to be a challenge.  So, for full-time candidates, we&#8217;ve adopted what companies like <a href="http://www.jeanhsu.com/2011/08/30/redesigning-technical-hiring-process/">Pulse</a> and <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/185/Startup-Hiring-Why-You-Should-Date-Before-Getting-Married.aspx">Hubspot</a> do.  We work with potential candidates on a contract basis first before extending a full-time offer.  Having done this a few times now, I *love* their method.  Our process from start to finish is pretty simple.  First, we screen resumes and interview people.  If we find someone we think we&#8217;d love to hire, we&#8217;ll work out a temporary contract to see if there&#8217;s a good fit on both sides.  Note: we absolutely pay for their work and use a standard contractor agreement to make sure ownership of the work is clear.  We do this with *everyone* who has made it passed the interview stage, including candidates who are currently working full time at another company.  In those cases, a shorter project that can be done on nights/weekends is more apt.  We&#8217;ve found that this process illuminates people&#8217;s working styles and personalities quite accurately.  Resumes and interviews can be a good way to test for competency, but it&#8217;s hard to determine culture fit and workflow without actually working with a person.</p>
<p>Of all the people we&#8217;ve worked with on a contract basis, we&#8217;ve only hired 40%.  This stat is actually disturbing to me, because it means we&#8217;re not good at knowing whom to hire based on interviews alone.  However, we&#8217;ve also found that we don&#8217;t actually need a long contract to predict if we&#8217;ll make an offer.  Usually, after about a calendar-week we&#8217;ll be able to accurately assess if we&#8217;ll end up making an offer at the end of the contract.</p>
<p>So, we don&#8217;t make contracts any longer than one month in deciding on a full-time position.  It&#8217;s super important to be clear about the length of the process and what is involved and not string people along.  This means that if we&#8217;re on the fence about someone at the end of a contract, we&#8217;ll just not do anything &#8212; a non-decision effectively becomes a decision to not hire.  We figure if we&#8217;re not super excited about working with a person after a month, then we wouldn&#8217;t be super excited as time went on.</p>
<p>To be clear, this process is a two way street.  During this short contract, a candidate can very much decide that working at LaunchBit is not for them.  So, when we do decide to make an offer, I&#8217;m always nervous, because I&#8217;m never sure if the candidate feels the same way about working at LaunchBit.  But, that&#8217;s the way it should be &#8212; both parties should know what they&#8217;re getting into before commiting to working together for a longer term.</p>
<p>How do you hire?</p>

<p>Last night, I was at Google on a panel talking about women in entrepreneurship.  Afterwards, I chatted with an attendee about the very early days of <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/">LaunchBit</a>.  I mentioned that one point, I&#8217;d lived at my parents&#8217; house to save money.  This shocked her and she replied, &#8220;Oh&#8230;I could never do that.&#8221;  Reflecting back, that was just the beginning of all the sacrifices that many people have made in order for LaunchBit to work.</p>
<p>There is so much that goes on behind the scenes of a startup &#8212; beyond actually running the core business.  Founders often don&#8217;t talk about personal hardship, but everyone has a scar, especially in the beginning.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-startups-really-survive/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>Last night, I was at Google on a panel talking about women in entrepreneurship.  Afterwards, I chatted with an attendee about the very early days of <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/">LaunchBit</a>.  I mentioned that one point, I&#8217;d lived at my parents&#8217; house to save money.  This shocked her and she replied, &#8220;Oh&#8230;I could never do that.&#8221;  Reflecting back, that was just the beginning of all the sacrifices that many people have made in order for LaunchBit to work.</p>
<p>There is so much that goes on behind the scenes of a startup &#8212; beyond actually running the core business.  Founders often don&#8217;t talk about personal hardship, but everyone has a scar, especially in the beginning.  After my failed startup Parrotview, I convinced my best friend Jennifer to start a company with me.  I&#8217;d wanted a second chance at doing a startup, and she was finishing up her PhD at MIT and decided that research was not for her.  So, I convinced her to move to Berkeley, where my husband and I had been living so that we could work together in-person.  She packed her bags and embarked on a long distance relationship with her boyfriend, who soon became her husband over the course of the next few months while still doing long distance to Boston.</p>
<p>I picked out Jennifer&#8217;s apartment in Berkeley that would double up as an office and workspace, and I chipped in for rent.  I felt bad that we could only afford an absolute junkhole.  We nicknamed the place &#8220;The Club,&#8221; because every night, bright blue and red lights would come through the window from the street below, as cops were arresting people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the home front, Curt and I were counting our pennies &#8211; he was a postdoc supporting both of us, and I was pouring money into the business.  Cash was tight.  Everyday, I was thankful that for just one more day, Curt was patient, Tim put up with his long distance marriage, Jennifer would be safe in that rathole, and that somehow everything would work out soon.</p>
<p>After almost a year of this, Curt took a job in Boston, so the three of us left Berkeley and moved to Boston, and Jennifer was reunited with her husband.  Just a few months later, Tim, Jennifer, and I moved back to the Bay Area to enter the <a href="http://500.co/accelerator/">500Startups accelerator program</a>.  To do this, Tim quit his job.  They also had a baby on the way, due just after Demo Day.  They moved in with her parents and had no car.  Jennifer would take public transportation to 500Startups everyday, which was a 2+ hour commute each way.  A few days after Demo Day, Jennifer and I went to a VC to pitch our company, and a few hours later, she went into the hospital to have her baby.  Investors were shocked to see a 9 month pregnant woman in their office, but honestly, it was just business-as-usual for us.  A couple weeks later, Jennifer was back to work.  Jennifer&#8217;s parents have been absolutely amazing in providing childcare.  I don&#8217;t know what we would&#8217;ve done without them.</p>
<p><span>We&#8217;ve come a long way from our days in Berkeley.  </span><span>We now make money, we pay ourselves, we&#8217;ve raised money, and we&#8217;ve hired people.  </span><span>When I reflect back, a lot of what we did to make things work seemed par for the course at the time &#8212; these are the kind of things you do for your company without batting an eye.  But what amazes me the most is how many friends and family have poured their lives into helping us make this work out &#8212; and continue to everyday.  This isn&#8217;t their dream, so it&#8217;s not something I take for granted.  On days that are tough, it&#8217;s this thought that motivates me even more.  </span></p>
<p>What sacrifices have you made to keep your startup alive?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you a secret.  Even though we&#8217;re based in the Valley, I don&#8217;t like to hire in the Valley.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we have employees in the Bay Area, but unless I find someone super duper absolutely phenomenal, I like to find talent in other parts of America.  In fact, unless you really want to relocate, I don&#8217;t want you to &#8212; I want you to continue being happy where you are already living.</p>
<p><strong>Can&#8217;t compete on price</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up in the Bay Area, I&#8217;d always imagined we would grow our product team here.  But, after seeing my friends do crazy commutes between SF and the South Bay (1-2 hrs each way), all the while flicking people off on 101, I was pretty certain that doesn&#8217;t make employees happy.  Moreover, in talking with friends running well-funded startups, I learned that salary prices had gone out of control for engineering talent.  I saw the writing on the wall.  If you want to hire solid talent as a startup, you can&#8217;t compete on price.</p>
<p><strong>Employee #1</strong></p>
<p>So when we talked to Zach from <a href="http://startupfrontier.com/">Startup Frontier</a> about hiring him, he said that he was excited about working with us but would not be able to relocate anywhere.  That&#8217;s when we started investing time and resources into making a remote workforce possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why companies really hate to hire remote workers</strong></p>
<p>Admittedly, I was uneasy at first about the idea of building a remote team.  So I made a list of the pros and cons.  There were a lot of pros: little/no commute, working environment of choice, being able to offer a competitive salary for the region, fewer workplace-distractions, and ability to maintain current social/community life.  The cons: harder to build a team and keep morale up, hard to inspire creativity and innovation, and easier for people to slack off when remote.  Having managed a remote team before, I can tell you that companies hate to hire remotely, because they feel like they have no idea if their team is excited, unhappy, or even working &#8212; the crux of the issue is that you feel like you have <em>no control</em> without face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>It starts with finding the right people regardless of where they are located.  Since we give every employee a project as a contractor before hiring him/her, we have a good sense of fit before we make the hire.  We only hire about 40% of people who go through this process &#8212; this is after they&#8217;ve already passed interviews with us.  But, all the other issues are big &#8212; how do you make everyone feel like they&#8217;re part of a team?  How do you keep people inspired?  How do you get people talking to spark new ideas?  How do you do all of this without distracting people?</p>
<p><strong>The magic of Facetime</strong></p>
<p>After lots of experimenting, we use Facetime.  We&#8217;ve given everyone on our team an iPad.  And, we keep Facetime on all day everyday.  I can be on a call with a customer from anywhere in the US, and if they have a question I can&#8217;t answer, I can verbally ask anyone on my team right then and there.  This works well with multiple iPads and a small team.  You really feel like all your colleagues are in the same room.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve even worked on optimizing the position of the iPads.  Having them head-on seemed creepy and stalkerish.  Placing them to the side makes it seem like you are working with someone side-by-side. You can see if he/she is heads-down in the middle of something important of if he/she is on a snack break.  A couple of our employees work in co-working spaces, and people in the co-working spaces stop by and say hi to everyone &#8212; they get to know the team.</p>
<p><strong>Does it scale? </strong></p>
<p>In a physical workplace, large organizations are broken down into small teams, so why can&#8217;t you have lots of small Facetime groups?  Our organization isn&#8217;t at that size yet, but I&#8217;m betting that it will work.  Facetime is just the beginning.  Technology &#8212; <a href="http://meetings.io">meetings.io</a> and <a href="http://vsee.com/">vsee</a> have interesting technology to make video-based group work even better.  Gone are the days of crazy commutes.  Gone are the days of giving up your friends to move for a job.  This is the future of work.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>I’m grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>We’ve spent the last few weeks swinging through the jungle with our friends at <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>.  I’m pleased to announce that after all this horsing around&#8230;errr monkeying around&#8230;we’ve integrated LaunchBit with MailChimp.  This simply means that MailChimp publishers can monetize their newsletters with our high quality text ads.  This is really exciting to me, because this is the beginning of making advertising look really beautiful.  We’ve been working with some of our publisher partners, including folks at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>, <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a>, and <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a> to get this right.  And, today we’re offering beautiful text ads to all MailChimp publishers currently in our network and to those who apply.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/monkey-business/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p>I’m also excited to announce the rollout of our <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/marketplace/">newsletter directory</a>.  Although there are a number of fantastic directories for blogs, there isn’t a single one for email newsletters.  Yet, we’ve heard from companies that they can’t find newsletters to buy or swap promotions in.  So, in our newsletter directory, you’ll be able to search for complementary companies.  If you have a high quality email newsletter, we encourage you to join <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/marketplace/">here</a> so that potential partners can find you to help you expand your business.</p>
