<p dir="ltr">Growing up in the Bay Area during the dot.com boom, my co-founder Jennifer and I have long been inspired by entrepreneurs and the technology they build to better the world.  (But perhaps more importantly, as teenagers, we were enamored with how much pizza you were allowed to eat. <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )  In fact, we thought startups were so exciting that we began talking about starting a business together even as early as freshman year in high school!  And in our junior year, we made a pact that someday we would go into business together.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AzOduVxafA2-rbNqDmhL4BCcYkZPPE8MnyThpwxGffWegWOw6kjcKEt6OKMIl6F0p8JdiKnTLVvjz7dzxDr4TiRXAKHrOHvKK9XNpPiTcNXW6AsmMwXdnEiiNTsTXIqlmQ" alt="in500.png" width="580px;" height="351px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>At 500Startups in 2011</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">A decade later, LaunchBit would become that business, and along the way, we’ve had the opportunity to work with an amazing set of customers, employees, investors, and advisors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hDLKyBhE-nNzuA9y78dGXH2xndH75wOieAbOvAYaPlnR1nKAHyPTw1r1AoxDP7ezCkG2D-wbByA_blOZgtJ6D5vdP_RlX6rwdpEli_zxJ0aJkGB9FOxVJeW_43isCIrkZQ" alt="unnamed.jpg" width="514px;" height="385px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Our first team offsite</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Building an adtech company from just a handful of advertisers and publishers in 2011 to a few hundred advertisers and thousands of publishers on newsletterdirectory.co has been quite a journey.  Looking back on our journey, Jennifer and I are proud of how much our team has accomplished in the last three years.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0rVLBq58bWlAUYklduynQL_OJM8f_3OCfnleReWwpJJS5RfvHRG0GwKimWsuPveTHNMekXoDg1ejikGROKNE0Biyif42BQ1OUoPOotRL4IvtuYf3tZUlVcDHhWSOeNhqGw" alt="IMAG0137.jpg" width="250px;" height="419px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Sending our best advertisers and publishers packages for the holiday</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As we continued our growth, we started partnering with larger ad networks including a company called <a href="http://www.buysellads.com">BuySellAds</a> (BSA).  BuySellAds is a premium ad network that reaches high quality tech audiences including developers, designers, and entrepreneurs amongst a number of other categories.  Over time, in working closely with them, we realized we shared a similar vision for adtech and goals.  It made a lot of sense to team up with them.  So, today, I’m pleased to publicly announce that BuySellAds is acquiring LaunchBit and will continue to run our cost-per-click network just the same as always.  It was important to Jennifer and me that if we were going to sell our company, it would be to someone who would run the business like we would.  I’m confident that BSA is that company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So for Jennifer and me, this is the end of our journey with LaunchBit, but we’re on to new adventures.  Thank you so much for all of your support!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cheers,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elizabeth</p>

<p><strong>The Myth of Going Viral</strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, my team and I created a roommate-finding app appropriately named Roommates. In a nutshell, it was just like Tinder&#8230;but for roommates. After our team had built an amazingly awesome app, we needed users! To find users we ended up creating a series of infographics that were seen by hundreds of thousands of people and featured in Techcrunch, Huffington Post, Curbed SF, Venture Beat, The Next Web, The New York Observer, and dozens of other media outlets.  Our infographic for San Francisco, for example, well exceeded 250k views in less than one week.</p>
<p><strong>The Myth &#8211; Dude, let’s just go viral!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-03-at-6.38.31-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6198" title="Going viral" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-03-at-6.38.31-AM-700x480.png" alt="" width="490" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be THAT hard right? I mean, all we had to do was create any ole&#8217; thing, post it to Twitter/Facebook, and watch the users flock to us like startup nerds to a Noah Kagan blog post.</p>
<p><em>After years of experience, I&#8217;ve found that this is anything but reality.</em></p>
<p>But after creating a ton of infographics that have been shared tens of thousands of times and have been seen by hundreds of thousands of people, I’ve learned that there are three steps to increase your chances of creating a viral infographic.</p>
<p>These steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your goal and target audience</li>
<li>Create irresistible and sticky content</li>
<li>Distribute so you create an avalanche</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets dig into each step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Define your goal and target audience</strong></p>
<p>When creating an infographic it&#8217;s important to first ask yourself “Who&#8217;s this for and why am I doing this?”</p>
<p>I know, I know, it sounds silly but 90% of people completely forget this first step. It&#8217;s easy to fall into the vanity trap of chasing traffic for traffic’s sake, but to go viral and make it a success you need to have a “how” AND a “why.”</p>
<p>Ultimately what you need to realize is that the goal is always a share, but beyond that it needs to be a sale, email conversion, or PR.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.upworthy.com">Upworthy</a> &#8212; the king of going viral. It&#8217;s pretty clear what they want &#8211; your dam* email address, and who they want it from – liberal leaning hip young folks who like Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, make sure you have a “why” before creating your content. But whether it’s a sale or email, make sure to never be tacky or to “self-promotey”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span><br />
Before creating content we knew our target was 18 – 30 year olds who living in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and New York. The goal was to covered by a large media outlet like Huffington Post or Techcrunch and to get downloads. The easy part was that our product &#8211; an app &#8211; was free.</p>
<p>Did it work? Yes.</p>
<p><em>Remember: Write down your goals and target audience before doing any type of content creation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Create sticky content</strong><br />
What the hell does that even mean? I read a lot of blogs and there&#8217;s one thing SEO specialists and marketers constantly say: create good, shareable content.</p>
<p>I HATE when I see that advice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so bland. It&#8217;s like saying “be fast and strong” when someone asks how to run a 4 minute mile. Yeah, thanks a lot&#8230;GREAT advice.</p>
<p>So here’s the deal: humans are fairly predictable creatures. If you&#8217;ve read <em>Made To Stick</em> or <em>Contagious</em> then you know there&#8217;s a science to creating sticking content. And I&#8217;ve broken it down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Niches make riches</li>
<li>That&#8217;s SO me</li>
<li>Names, names, names</li>
<li>Be controversial, funny, or useful</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Niches make riches (if it rhymes it makes sense&#8230;no matter what)</span><br />
When creating content, it&#8217;s easy to try and appeal to everyone, but that mindset will only guarantee failure. In fact, you should do the exact opposite, which means create something that only a small, passionate group of care about rather than appealing to a large, apathetic group.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the top posts from from the subreddit r/programming. If you&#8217;re not a programmer chances are that not a single one of these article titles will make sense to you.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YiTVU9zPOWZIvKWQSwpA_SmNtaBqLvDu7BLNduEVKvzYsPlYNlzcosYErA6TE8BL3BczpDSMxIQp4O1JFi9_KW_2uxEtHimUbh-ojKyXbjSFkdnkYOMWNKWBhjru1nu07g" alt="" width="624px;" height="412px;" /></p>
<p>But check out how many times the 2nd most popular article has been shared.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1Imhq27aQ5JsujaVCEDbhLk8ry_lZs7f_XXzZSxLoFVVLazELOAW-8-YDajIskIiCLMJsFXeTSnC7ZQh46GydDLSbs7VcFTsEsdPYXsLX6Zu8ZNkOPRQZLTxvWE_99KDPA" alt="" width="624px;" height="236px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>408 times!</strong></p>
<p>Sure, the article doesn’t  mean much to YOU, but it does resonate with a small, passionate group of people – programmers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you don’t live in San Francisco then the San Francisco article will be pointless to you. In fact, even if you live in SF a lot of the jokes won’t make sense. To really understand each joke you need to live in the neighborhood we made fun of.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TnWO5Gl9UUDt-xkHuqoFOlgxTganrSPhnY4E54saIGVEXPit37GVJ5BtpG1mEIJ9tfLaUqNUYLsljNY4awWZPD3kqgJxK9b7c0N-BFi526AZMZnyEdc1fdLoou_H__kuDA" alt="" width="435px;" height="383px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">You won’t get this joke&#8230;unless you’ve lived in The Marina neighborhood in SF.  <strong>Remember: If you try to appeal to everyone you&#8217;ll appeal to no one at all. Create content that&#8217;s insightful or funny for a very small, passionate group of people, not a huge, apathetic group.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. That&#8217;s SO me!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Similar to the Niches Make Riches theory, when writing sticky content you want readers to identify with your content to the point where they say “Wow, this is so me!” or “I know someone JUST like this.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/F75Ic2i_gVGqAhDGW8MtPNCJngh4I7pVkHsn7pPH06IAdlQRhacBvX-HAiiXszn7WIcX05BuWhPnDt3N6qXKILFAa_zKLpEYE8c7nC8ZVoMnVYjVrTt5td_9mUaufCE6Sw" alt="" width="624px;" height="415px;" /></p>
<p>People want to share something that represents themselves or their friends in a funny/cool way. It&#8217;s not rocket science. It feels good to laugh at yourself. Just look at just about any Buzzfeed quiz. Title’s like “What Friend’s character are you” or “10 ways you know you’re from Boston.” People feel special when they see something that represents themselves online&#8230;and they’ll wanna share it!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We created stereotypes for each neighborhood in San Francisco and predicted where they worked. Because we picked such popular employers, it was inevitable that many people who lived in that neighborhood also worked at the employer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h8dz8rQTq5hjt0riSG1wbHKbMmG8G3Bjb7vn5XzB2ORd_7HBKvXut20vJl1Havc7c8ZFVoWD3yWZeKWxLNCXQYxQILohFEO0DrDlkRfrjU6nTb3C4dIou_GpfVdeOlNK1A" alt="" width="624px;" height="227px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Names, Names, Names</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoover Adams was the founder of <em>The Daily Dunn</em>, the local newspaper in Dunn, North Carolina. It&#8217;s one of the most successful newspapers in the country – on average, every household buys 1.12 copies (apparently couples don&#8217;t know how to share). When asked what his secret was, Adams said he&#8217;d had the same strategy for 40 years. It boiled down to three things: names, names, names.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What people wanted, Adams discovered, was to see their name and their friend&#8217;s names in the paper. “If I could” Adams once said, “I&#8217;d publish pages from the phone book.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o0UwbO1RTyG21CpR4gk4ZsTYp1HxfV_8saEKFjjVh_fdvi_Xm1OHUZE6ndcZgTz3EpvL2WsVwcfTeKtTaxdTvkiK3x1wFDhhbl7yQqGwBT7Z4mn2XmKbvITxKbfh9LwTCQ" alt="" width="381px;" height="285px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoover Adams</p>
<p> A person&#8217;s name is the most beautiful sound in the world. Not only do people LOVE reading about themselves, they also love reading about the people/things they know and identify with. This concept is perhaps the most powerful on this list because the people you mention in your content will almost always share the content with their followers. I like to call these people “stakeholders.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made sure to always specifically name employers, restaurants and people, because not only did they share the content, but their fans did as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BHiAxP4V0p6qOVIbS1xFd8eDbjgNtL5BQyhUHeTS6t6uU5oEHk5mhf8IV_Y5jWKDf4jJ3RrppnlGxzt0pqUhZIFIa9qrFj5kqw8yxzEx37HM4Odlpff-jmnwEo1eQgrH4A" alt="" width="441px;" height="385px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Examples of how we’d name specific companies</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MDVH9GjietVM6hLz2FawMmq_Cp0GPlQolKyA5rB30Rc6Eh-XsShDzXMEZuizS9O98VNAHXmOQ_iiKAEE2CXC7dnTo36lZmozCc4_BxJYJhvfjjQom8k_5CAt6zTf80XMHQ" alt="" width="607px;" height="291px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Be controversial, funny, interesting, or useful</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is easier said than done and if done incorrectly you can really hurt your brand – so be careful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you provide value, like being funny or useful, people will share your content. For example, if you’ve found this article helpful I hope you’ll share it <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Check out Neil Patel&#8217;s famous <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-seo/">Advanced SEO Guides</a>. They are crazy helpful and also extremely popular.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NEVER try to make a homophobic or racist joke. Sure, some people have pulled it off in a funny and tasteful way, but the risk of it failing is too great. And never make your content sad. It&#8217;s been proven that the most shared content is typically happy and uplifting, not depressing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9kIk9OpeKY66L92jyfo8j5K15xet6P-SmVQRo_zwhfXR1EDAMlxGuHo_7HbK5_RDqHC_c-txTz1TDcbTG245UQJCeyqfF7mduLndQ6WPWSO6qpQ5zxrA-RWW_8AAOSKCtw" alt="" width="336px;" height="131px;" />      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jgm9rznw57Ye-tOgnHed7Mr5UnW10VmHBi8Zr1jBGNIAg3O06AL3E62KS0OCBXjpm1BX0sMDvZHoE0F0AuxMoY9IzvcS-Fh61FZiGWMauG2lnaF6Y1YQB1cl8vS6H5UjXQ" alt="" width="247px;" height="163px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fun tip: Need help brainstorming? Check out these places</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Yelp</strong>: I&#8217;ve never been to New York, but I helped create a popular infographic about New York neighborhoods. I was able to do this because I read every review for the most popular places on Yelp to understand the culture. Always check out the most popular, highest reviewed, and lowest reviewed places on Yelp and read the comments for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Gold. There&#8217;s a subreddit for everything. Check out the highest votest threads of the past week, month, or year for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Top posts from other blogs</strong>: if you have a target audience in mind, check out other blogs they read and find the top posts. Use this as inspiration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Step 3. Distribute</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, so now you&#8217;ve got some sticky content. Now what?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Distribute!</p>
<p dir="ltr">You&#8217;re not Kevin Costner and this isn&#8217;t Field Of Dreams. One of the biggest misconceptions in content creation is if you create it, people will magically come – but this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going viral is like an avalanche and rarely an accident, once it gets started it builds up and gets bigger and bigger&#8230;but you&#8217;re responsible for the first step.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are my favorite three ways to distribute your sticky content:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Reddit/Hacker News/And similar sites</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">They say that Reddit is the front page of the internet&#8230;and I completely agree. The most popular memes, trends and internet jokes typical start at Reddit. With over 100 million monthly unique visitors, Reddit is a fantastic place to kick off your viral avalanche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The key to succeeding on Reddit is finding the right subreddit. You should only post your content in a relevant subreddit, otherwise you&#8217;ll be accused of spamming.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BJYlYt6NmfQipKts_M_DQKpLusWTdEqjqtTsnQ56A658_9hNCOGKLPEKdJyRmZKga4qLkJI2zyYjy0k8PO0M9gFBMGltqE6jEBQ3P6k2D5irwXmkjahaacpazhIJ9wOaCw" alt="" width="624px;" height="216px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">When creating the Roommates&#8217; infographic, Reddit was always the first place to post. But be careful&#8230;if you post too much you&#8217;ll be accused of spam, and you cannot delete people&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fAF4y2ZeGSN4tq6WBfz15-uWJsKu3BZNDeiZjC8-oH7StzxQMr6qFuSztQ2VNENvIG1fKh8MwKICYY2l0AWMk8Fsipe8LjsJSrewQBe4BxAlwiNnfLo09-aCHyumx5HZGA" alt="" width="431px;" height="263px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Other sites similar to Reddit are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker News</li>
<li>Digg</li>
<li>Product Hunt</li>
<li>Inbound.org</li>
<li>GrowthHackers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember when we talked about the importance of naming specific people, places, and companies? Well, we may have had a sneaky little reason behind exactly who we named.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9uMmUe23hRl6iExcsb8XgSRkABhRfz8TGgBODS9I49KK-TwlIWBvGzwT6Jrb9gdgyI0Yo-5ybYCgAfpka6AAhMvPapEX4f-YHk55H0_TsxPYvArUvFQctpgAaxawpvI4Sw" alt="" width="183px;" height="187px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">When creating viral content, it&#8217;s important to work backwards. Rather naming funny people in your content and hoping they&#8217;ll share, you should find people who: have a large following and you know they&#8217;ll share.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stakeholders will naturally share things they&#8217;re mentioned it. It feels good to be mentioned online&#8230;so they&#8217;ll want others to know.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made sure to only mention people who had at least 5,000 Twitter followers. This wasn&#8217;t an exact science, but over time we realized it worked. Before launch day we&#8217;d list all the stakeholder&#8217;s Twitter and Facebook handles. When the big day came we simply Tweeted at them and post on their wall. 9/10 times people retweeted or shared with their followers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1qOhhSDdciBdhB8V4zC5_pdjkJJhFnQIVRoMEfvLU1bk1-TaouEXx_WQm7cDNrOwdvIlDrDdAmZ8EZMFKyKFFYxFUwLHIc4GBV9gG_WfwISDsEBUOxEBpcfUUyptW07wuQ" alt="" width="624px;" height="216px;" /><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ol5l6t5nE7pnerEZth3qAJLZNDT02bAs58UtgMTkywnGIciCcZljhL85raE3ceqOrAn0u6T9TTzeWM27qoKEkCiHNLp1vf-rx4MMalUrBDjZI66fpE8fLd7pAbatYw7vZg" alt="" width="575px;" height="319px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Big Media and Influencers</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Big media coverage or retweets from big names can make or break your viral launch. I like to break this category into two sections: big media and influencers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Big media</strong>: Getting coverage from Techcrunch, New York Times, or Huffington Post can be huge. Not only will this type of coverage create a trickle down effect and convince other blogs/media to write about you, but you&#8217;ll also capture huge amounts of residual traffic months or even years after your initial launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The good news is that most of the journalists from big media will troll Reddit for popular stories, which is yet another reason why you should post your content on Reddit. Additionally, big media likes to follow smaller blogs for story ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want media coverage, I suggest emailing small blogs first and working your way up the chain. This can be a tricky thing and if you want to become an expert at this then I suggest reading Ryan Holiday&#8217;s book <em>Trust Me I&#8217;m Lying</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But beware: 7/10 times big media will screw up your article. Whether they write incorrect information or forget to link to your site, it&#8217;s important not to solely count on big media.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVEr5CCmqRnmsczlB5m3QsND1s_on_a3Kt9Pc1VWyqciAKiOmTMs6ImyeMx8QuH8WRrnpgMhP8onl2MV4NVwyhgvhAnL29oCnUYoQCW7S28kaQdt7LL7aHjs5FXe-58QLQ" alt="" width="624px;" height="277px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Influencers: Similar to big media, influencers will have a similar trickle down effect. While influencers may not have as much traffic, chances are their following is more loyal and they&#8217;re easier to contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2XpvesmNIT7dahlUtrYse4ZU8Nf8q5hkxf2luWW5xMDvH--vnsMv0NvLaOA1Ng_1VYr-XKh8uPLndzOXarDPceL7L96snjfENnISZqGpI949cyxSdzd-Yu-VTEP-pjKOkQ" alt="" width="512px;" height="152px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, there you have it.  This is how I was able to manufacture hundreds of thousands of views on my infographics.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Editor&#8217;s note: </em>For more great tips on viral marketing from Sam, check out his conference <a href="http://www.hustlecon.com">Hustle Con</a>, which is on August 1 in San Francisco.  The focus of this conference is to teach scrappy ways of doing customer acquisition.  Although it&#8217;s geared towards startup founders, who often don&#8217;t have the luxury of attention and press whenever they want, every marketer will learn a TON at this event.  You will learn about other viral marketing mechanisms, such as how Rohin Dhar, the CEO of Priceonomics, grew his blog from 0 to 2.3M monthly visitors with content creation.  Full disclosure: LaunchBit organized the conference last year and this year serves as an advisor.</p>

<p>All too often, customer support is viewed as just a warm and fuzzy activity and from a business perspective, a major cost center. But, at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/">LaunchBit</a>, our business perspective is that it is a good marketing channel. These are the types of people who typically write to our support line, which we triage using <a href="http://freshdesk.com/">Freshdesk</a>: 1) prospective customers, 2) current customers, and 3) salespeople (people trying to sell us stuff).</p>
<p>When we started LaunchBit, I did all customer support myself. These days, someone else on my team does customer support, but I think it&#8217;s still important for me to get involved from time to time to maintain a pulse on what is happening on the front lines of our business. This is how I view emails from the above 3 groups of people:</p>
<p><strong>1) Prospective customers</strong><br />
Supporting these people is a no brainer. It goes without saying that supporting these people can increase revenues, and customer support effectively becomes a lead generation opportunity. But, when I hop on the front lines, I often find that supporting this group of people isn&#8217;t always efficient. I notice that we&#8217;ll often get the same questions over and over. And though we can set up templates using Freshdesk, there is still a time-cost for us to respond to emails. By hopping back on the front lines from time to time, I&#8217;m able to see how we can improve our product to reduce inquiries that prospective customers can answer themselves through our FAQs or other marketing collateral.</p>
<p><strong>2) Current customers</strong><br />
Supporting this group of people is also a no brainer. But contrary to what you might think, we don&#8217;t see support of this group as an immediate revenue generating opportunity per se. It may be. But, this is not our expectation. The goal in supporting this group of people is to learn how we can improve our solution and be more helpful to our customers. Along the way, we may also learn what other opportunities may exist to help further (which may eventually lead to an increased revenue opportunity). But, the purpose in serving this group of people is to improve our company, often leading to product improvements and messaging clarity.</p>
<p><strong>3) Salespeople</strong><br />
Lastly, you may be surprised to learn that we spend some time triaging emails from prospective salespeople. It may be counterintuitive to spend time with people who are trying to sell you something. We actually see this as a potential lead generation opportunity. When people write to us, they are reaching out to build rapport, and if the person is a good fit, we&#8217;ll often engage and try to see how we might be able to work together. You may be surprised to learn that we have actually gotten sales from people trying to sell us! Note: conversions in this category are significantly lower than the first category though, so by hopping on the front lines, I&#8217;m able to continue to assess how we can tweak our triaging process to determine whom to engage with.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t always do customer support, I&#8217;ve found that jumping on the front lines helps us engage with these three types of people who write to us. And, getting firsthand experience around the kinds of emails we&#8217;re continually receiving is important for me to keep in mind as I think about how we do our customer acquisition and improve our marketing messaging.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I can’t remember how many conversations I&#8217;ve had with people about how they threw some money at paid advertising and then were severely disappointed when the results came back nil.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/as-if.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5824" title="as if" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/as-if.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So I asked them, “Well, how much did you spend?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When their answers came back to me I was not surprised one bit that they had less than impressive results with their paid ad campaigns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One self-proclaimed b2b marketing pro responded, “I put $50 on the Facebook ad exchange and I got nothing.” Another said, “It was the worst $20 I’ve ever spent.” One hopeless soul even said she’d spent only $10 and was irate at the lack of clicks her ad received.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The truth is that you need to spend a significant amount on paid advertising for it to have an effect. Not only that, but it will also take time to optimize your campaigns.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s a significant amount that will get you an impact?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, your end goal shouldn’t simply be to generate a lot of clicks. Your objective is to get people to sign up for your offer and eventually become a paying customer. So you first need to determine how much you can spend to obtain each new customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s how you do this….</p>
<p dir="ltr">Determine your the average lifetime value of your current customer by taking the total revenue collected over the past 12 months and divide by the number of customers or clients you have. If you have multiple revenue streams that vary widely, you may want to do <a href="http://www.cloudstrategies.biz/dont-be-a-customer-lifetime-value-simpleton/">weighted averages.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Your ultimate aim is most likely to acquire a new customer at <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">⅓ your average customer’s lifetime value</a>. So, if your average customer lifetime value is $3,000, then you will aim to spend $1,000 (⅓ of $3,000) to acquire a new customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s significantly higher than the $10 my hopeless friend tried on her paid ad campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clueless2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5826" title="clueless2" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clueless2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So $1,000, in this example, is also the minimum budget you need to determine if a particular paid ad channel is worthwhile, because this is how much it may take you to acquire a new customer.  By paid channel I mean an ad network like BuySellAds, an ad exchange like Facebook Ads, or a customer acquisition platform like LaunchBit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anything less will likely result in those nil results and you will end up wasting your money. Here’s <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-test-customer-acquisition-channels-for-value/">a 3-step process</a> to break it down for you even further.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why does the LaunchBit platform require a $1,000 minimum?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To answer this question for you, I reached out to our Co-founder and CTO, Jennifer Chin. Here’s what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“In order for an advertiser to determine whether a channel is a good fit, they need to have enough engagement in order to see a trend. Typically, they&#8217;re looking for some trend in conversion. Is the conversion rate high or low?  If a budget is too small, a marketer may not be able to generate enough clicks in order to confidently make a decision about whether we&#8217;re a good fit or not. And that just means they&#8217;ve wasted time, energy, and money to reach no conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Google has claimed you can start a campaign with just $5. How likely is that to give you an adequate picture of the results of any typical marketing channel?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Technically that’s true, and with only $5 maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and someone will convert right away. But regardless, you&#8217;ll have no idea whether the results you see are indicative of the marketing channel in the long run. If your boss asks whether you will commit 100% of your Q2 marketing budget to this channel based on a $5 test, what will you say?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Generally speaking, at LaunchBit, we don&#8217;t want our customers to waste their time, energy, and money, and we&#8217;re pretty certain that if they spend less than $1,000 on our platform, they&#8217;re not going to get definitive results about their campaigns.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>That makes sense, right? I’m sure you’re still wondering about ROI.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hitting performance goals is obviously important.  Performance marketers are looking for sales in their test campaigns, because that’s truly how to <a href="https://www.launchbit.com/new-campaign/%20">understand whether a certain paid channel</a> is worthwhile. Often a good proxy for this is the number and quality of leads you’re able to acquire from a channel with your $1,000 budget. Let’s say on average out of the 100 people that click on your ad, 25 of them <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-create-and-optimize-high-converting-landing-pages/">convert into a lead on your landing page</a>. You’ll need to know the average number of leads required in order to make one sale as well as the average number of landing page visitors to sign up for whatever your paid ad promised them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paid ad gets the clicks &gt; landing page converts to lead &gt; eventually becomes a sale</p>
<p dir="ltr">So let’s say that on average 1 out of those 25 leads become a sale. This means that you need at least 25 leads in order to get a sale. If you are spending $1,000 minimum budget and need at least 25 leads, your cost per lead can be roughly no more than $1,000/25 = $40 per lead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is your average cost per lead, and even with $1,000 budget it’s not ideal. You can do better, but you have to spend a significant amount of money to get significant results in order to make better decisions about your paid ad campaign and so you can stop wasting your money.</p>

<p>“Marketers regularly talk to us about their goals, and for many it boils down to one major theme: generating leads, and ultimately driving purchases.” <em>– Twitter Advertising (@TwitterAds)</em></p>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/launchbit"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5786" title="settings" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/settings-700x242.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>The Lead Generation Card makes it easy for users to express interest in what your brand offers. When someone expands your Tweet, they see a description of the offer and a call to action. The user simply clicks a button to send this information directly (and securely) to you. <strong>Learn how to set this up in 3 easy steps.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>
<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 1: Create your card</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">In your account settings, click Twitter ads and scroll over to the Creatives dropdown menu. This is where you create, modify, send, and track your Twitter cards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5787" title="5" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-700x298.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Card Content</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is where your card begins to come to life and Twitter makes it easy. Simply fill in the required fields with that clever b2b content rattling around in your head.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Short description:</strong> This where you tell your followers or other Twitter users what you’re offering or promoting. It’s what they received by clicking your call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Card image:</strong> This is where you get to show off your creativity. This image will be shown to users as part of your card. It must be at least 600 pixels wide, and must have a width:height aspect ratio of 4:1. Consider this somewhat odd size before selecting a picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Call to action:</strong> This is where you get your followers or Twitter users to click. The call to action text is displayed on the button inside the card.</p>
<p dir="ltr">*Notice also that you can switch views from mobile to web to see how your card looks on multiple devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5788" title="2" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2-700x454.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You must also provide a link to your privacy policy on your site in order to use the Lead Generation card. All Twitter cards must include this link so users can see what data is being collected and how it&#8217;s being used. A simple copy and paste of the link to the  privacy policy on your company website should do the trick.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Fallback URL</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is the URL where (1) users can learn more about your offer after they sign up for your offer, and (2) users will be redirected to if they view the card on a non-supported platform, such as a third party Twitter client. This URL should point to a generic page on your site such as your homepage or a lead generation form that you host on your site. If your Twitter card is promoting a recent white paper, ideally you want them to show interest by clicking you call to action and you can follow up by sending it to them via email. The Fallback should only be a back up, not a page to obtain more information.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fallback1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5790" title="fallback" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fallback1-700x429.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Destination URL</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Adding a destination URL lets us redirect the user to your specified landing page after they submit the lead. This may act as a thank you page, and you can create a thank you message for this URL right in Twitter. This is optional and should not be used to obtain more information from your users.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Name Your Card</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Tell Twitter what you want to name your card. This won’t be visible to anyone but you or the managers of your Twitter Ads account. Agree to the terms and click ‘Create card.’</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/8.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5792" title="8" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/8-700x436.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 2: Tweet Your Card</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">Once you create your card, it will be listed in your Card Manager for you to access whenever you want. Just click the link <strong>Compose Tweet with this card.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">*Note that you can use your card multiple times for multiple tweets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You compose a tweet like any other tweet. Your Twitter card will take up 23 characters, so you only have 117 left to show you can hang with all the other clever b2b marketers out there and write something insanely catchy with the limited space you’re given.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Then you must choose how you want it delivered. This dictates not only how much you want to pay, but also who will see your Twitter card.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Standard:</strong> Delivered to only your twitter followers and no money spent. Your CPL is $0 for this one. If don’t want to spend your budget on paid Twitter cards, you can still create them and tweet them out on your own profile, but only your followers will see them. It acts as a normal tweet and the only increase in reach will be if your followers retweet your card.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Promoted only:</strong> Delivered to a targeted audience based on chosen keywords or hashtags; this is not delivered to your followers. You can pay to expand your reach – this is a part of the sponsored ads you often see spread across the social network. Surely, you’re likely to obtain more clicks with an expanded reach and key placement near the top of the feed.</p>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5793" title="10" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10-700x446.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Promotion</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is where you can select campaigns to promote this tweet. If you have previous paid Twitter Ad campaigns, you can attach your card to any of those campaigns.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Scheduling</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This one is obvious enough. Here, you can tweet now or schedule it for later.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Click ‘Tweet,’ then just go back to your Cards Manager to watch your numbers start rolling.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 3: Manage Your Leads</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">Every user you persuade to click your card becomes a lead. You can organize this lead information in one of two ways. If you have a CRM, you can integrate that with Twitter and the lead info will automatically populate your CRM. If you don’t have a CRM or you don’t want to integrate it with Twitter, the lead information is simply put into a downloadable list in Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div>  <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5794" title="download" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/download-700x200.png" alt="" /></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can also scroll over to the Analytics dropdown menu</strong> to see the performance of your Twitter cards.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Snapshot</strong> gives you a quick glance at how Tweets with your Twitter cards drove URL clicks. You can also measure how your cards did over time</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Change over time</strong> shows you how Tweets with your Twitter cards affected your impressions and clicks</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Card types</strong> show top performing cards that drove clicks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Links</strong> in Tweets with your Twitter cards that got the most clicks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Influencers</strong>, or top accounts that tweeted links to your content.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tweets</strong> with your Twitter cards that drove the most clicks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">

</ul>

<p>Let’s say you have two different blog posts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By setting up URL tracking to analyze and compare your blog content or various ad creatives and the different channels you place them in, you can measure the actions and behavior of your traffic and optimize your b2b marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>So how do you set up URL parameters? Keep scrolling…</p>
<p>For simplicity, I’m going to focus on setting up URL parameters for your blog posts, but keep in mind that this exact process can be used for any link you want to track, including ad creatives.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have two different blog posts.</p>
<p><strong>One has URL parameters. </strong>That means that when someone clicks on this link, that visit will be categorized by Google Analytics how you want this information organized &#8212; based on the referral data for this particular blog post.</p>
<p><strong>The other has no URL parameters. </strong>That means that while Google Analytics will attempt to classify traffic that comes from this source, it will not categorize the data how you specify. In general, GA does a good job of determining the source of traffic automatically, but I should point out that if you do NOT establish parameters for a URL you place in an email, GA will not be able to track it as coming from email. It will be labeled as ‘direct’ or not categorized at all. So it&#8217;s better to set up these URL parameters so that GA can collect the data you want and give you the analytics you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Teacher-Google-Analytics.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5744 alignnone" title="Teacher-Google-Analytics" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Teacher-Google-Analytics-700x542.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="542" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image credit: spinnaker.com</em></p>
<p><strong>Tell Google how you want to collect referral data</strong></p>
<p>URL parameters, or UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) tags allow you to add extra information to the link you create. This extra information appears in the Google Analytics reports under Traffic Sources. <strong>GA is so smart that it will recognize any parameter (UTM) you place after the question mark</strong> and automatically populate your account with exact words you tell it to.</p>
<p>There is a certain way to formulate these. For each new parameter, you need to add <strong>utm_medium=. </strong>This is how GA recognizes and organizes your traffic data. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>utm:</strong> you’re telling GA that you’re adding a parameter to the URL</p>
<p><strong>_medium=:</strong> this is a pre-established term in GA that tells it how to organize data</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the equal sign, type whatever word you want GA to call this parameter in your specific account for this specific blog. If you place this URL in an email, maybe you want to type in ‘email,’ or if you tweet this URL, maybe you want to type in ‘twitter,’ or ‘social.’ It’s completely up to you.</p>
<p>*Note that this is just one parameter. You will establish at least three per URL. Confused? Keep scrolling…</p>
<p>For instance, this is your original blog URL:</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin, simply place question mark at the end: ?</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/<strong>?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then establish your parameters: utm_source=social</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?<strong>utm_source=social</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to put a symbol in between new parameters: &amp;</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?utm_source=social<strong>&amp;utm_medium=twitter</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>By the time you’re done, the URL is very long:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re asking yourself where the numbers and percentages came from, don’t worry.  I’ll explain in a second.</p>
<p>Ok, so you understand URL parameters (UTMs) and how they actually work to grab information in your various marketing channels. This is good. Now I’m going to tell you that there are great tools out there to make this easier.</p>
<p><strong>This best tool you can use</strong> for this is Google’s very own <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en">URL Builder</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/d1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5746 alignnone" title="d" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/d1-700x615.png" alt="" width="700" height="615" /></a></p>
<p>You can make the Source and Medium what you want, but to stay sane I chose a description for my blogs and then stuck with it. If I want to put my link in Twitter, I use ‘social’ for Source and ‘twitter’ for Medium. I put ‘blog’ in the Content field since I haven’t specified this in any other field yet. The Term field is for you to specify your paid keywords, but not necessary since I’m not paying to promote this blog.</p>
<p>*Note that I always use lowercase so GA doesn’t group things in ways I don’t want.</p>
<p>The Campaign Name is what I use most often, so I just copy and paste the title of my blog into this field in the URL builder. This is the first thing GA displays to me when I click Campaigns.</p>
<p>*Note that the URL Builder adds %20 for spaces and GA adds dashes. So if I copy and paste the blog title, <em>Why your headline doesn’t hold my attention</em> into the Campaign Name, the new URL (with parameters) will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=<strong>why %20your%20headline%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20hold%20my%20attention</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Google Analytics the Campaign will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GA224.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="GA22" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GA224.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>But you can go deeper</strong></p>
<p>It’s smart to use as many fields as you can in the URL builder. It helps you go deeper and get a better idea of where exactly your traffic is coming from and which content they like. The actual URL is not going to display in GA (not the original and not the tagged URL), so you need to add the right information in the right field so that it displays correctly in GA.</p>
<p>This can get complicated. You’ll want to use the same field descriptions for the same types of content so that GA can lump them together. You don’t want something like this to show up Google Analytics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7b.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5748 alignnone" title="7b" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7b-700x101.png" alt="" width="700" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>These are all going to the same blog actually. This was back in my amateur days. Mistake 1 was that I made the Campaign Name two different things (e.g. blog ad blog7). Mistake 2 was that I didn’t consider the fact that GA default settings take into consideration capital letters (e.g. Blog and blog). So even though they are the same thing, one has a capital so GA thinks they are different. I’m all for learning by doing, but it can cause some headaches.</p>
<p><strong>A spreadsheet is great way to keep yourself organized. </strong></p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/xls1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5751 alignnone" title="xls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/xls1-700x185.png" alt="" width="700" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember to set up parameters for each channel</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need a different URL with different parameters for each channel (as pictured above), but all these parameters link back to the same blog post so you know where traffic came from for each blog post.</p>
<p>Do this correctly, and you’ll be in a better position to determine where your traffic came from so you can place your blogs, ads, or any content you have in the proper channels and optimize your b2b campaign.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I’ve<a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/moronic-monday-how-do-i-create-a-great-landing-page/"> written before</a> that creating a great landing page is really quite simple once you understand the basics. You don’t need a 50-point checklist to figure out if yours is up to standards, but you do need to split test your elements if you want to optimize your conversions. Here are 5 things you should test on your landing pages and what some of today’s foremost marketing pros have to say about them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. The headline</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The<a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-headlines-are-the-most-important-landing-page-element-to-split-test/"> headline is the most important thing</a> to split test. Ask yourself, is your primary headline phrased to answer the question “What is this page about?”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://unbounce.com/author/michael-aagaard/">Michael Aagaard</a>, self-confessed split test junkie and copywriting fanatic, conducted <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/5-landing-page-headline-formulas-tested/">3 case studies</a> with an accumulated sample size of a little over 50.000 visitors. He was able to see an overall pattern in the results. When doing landing page headline tests, a clear headline that focuses on a benefit generally performs best. While super creative headlines might be the right approach for offline marketing, the results of the studies show very little data indicating that this assumption holds true in the world of online marketing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Aagaard goes on to say that he “has yet to see a creative headline beat a clear headline in an A/B test.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, the clear (perhaps boring) headline outperformed the creative (a.k.a. sexy) headline and sold <strong>38.46% more memberships.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-headlines.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5726 aligncenter" title="5 things headlines" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-headlines.png" alt="" width="353" height="288" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Images</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Are you using a relevant and original main image that shows whatever you offer being used? Images are important because they reinforce what it is that you’re offering and help persuade your visitors to take action. You should aim to have your images link with your unique value proposition and main message. Hawk Host<a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/02/21/multivariate-testing-a-real-life-example/"> A/B tested their image</a> and saw that the <strong>padlock converted 2-3x better than the original.</strong> The padlock provided visitors with a message of security (much more so than the image of the globe).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-image.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5727" title="5 things image" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-image.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Form and call to action placement</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you make it clear what your visitors will receive by clicking your call to action? Is it in a prominent location on your page? <a href="http://www.measuredsem.com/">MeasuredSEM</a> tested the location of their landing page form and call to action. They had the same exact offer/CTA that lived at the end of the sales copy on an SEO landing page and repeated it again above the fold. This gave visitors the option of<a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing#."> converting sooner vs later</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“If users are ready to convert, don&#8217;t make them wait b/c you may lose them.” – <a href="http://www.ken-lyons.com/">Ken Lyons</a>, Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.measuredsem.com/">MeasuredSEM</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Location is key, but <strong>you should also try button size.</strong> Shawn Livengood is the Online Marketing Manager for BuildASign.com; he did a lot of tests on the text content and images, and<a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing#."> nothing really moved the dial</a>.  But then, he made the button bigger and saw a huge lift. So then he made the button bigger still. Another success! A good rule of thumb is to make the CTA large enough to stand out<a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/checklist/"> from 6ft away</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-button-size.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5731" title="5 things button size" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-button-size.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>But what about testing button color?</strong> Testing button color should not be on your list of things to test. Placement of form/cta is most important, followed by button size, not color. It should be obvious that your button should stand out from the rest and attract visitors eyes, but time should not be spent testing this. We agree with landing page guru Oli Gardner when he says, <em>“Testing button color is overrated, it’s all about contrast.”</em> Accomplish this and you’re visitors are far more likely to convert.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Quotes and customer testimonies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you provide examples of previous customers using or complementing your product/service? 37signals changed the design of their page by adding a picture of a person and a testimony. It <strong>increased signups by 102.5%</strong>. The type of background<a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final"> with a person really sticks out</a> from most of the other pages on the internet. It may signal to the visitor the importance of the website and make them want to read more of the offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are getting people to sign up for a webinar, a good idea is to show number of registrants and customer testimonials as social proof. WikiJob had<a href="http://www.salesnexus.com/blog/the-importance-of-using-testimonials"> three testimonials</a> on their page and saw a <strong>34% increases in conversions.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-testimonials.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5730" title="5 things testimonials" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-testimonials.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Copy text</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you tested using a short page vs. a long page to understand how much information your visitors need to convert? Let’s go back to 37 signals. They  tried long copy on their Highrise page with the same background vs short copy. The<a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final"> long page performed worse</a>; 22.72% worse, actually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Remove 50% of the copy, then delete half of what’s left.” &#8211; Steven Krug, Information architect and user experience professional.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-length1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738" title="5 things length" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-length1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you use bullet points to describe the benefits of your product/service? Using bullet points on your landing page is very important. They help synthesize compelling information and make it very easy for someone to quickly skim the landing page. ContentVerve.com <a href="http://contentverve.com/online-copywriting-case-studies-with-examples/">conducted an experiment </a>where they tested completely generic form copy against a version where they added a few bullets. The form with the <strong>bullets received 83.75% more newsletter sign-ups.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The above are good examples of what other companies have done to increase conversions. Realize that testing your landing pages can move the needle for your marketing campaigns, but don’t let all the data and numbers overwhelm you, and don’t complicate it. This<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/test-landing-pages-for-maximum-conversions/"> shouldn&#8217;t stifle your creativity</a>, but rather should be another tool to optimize your conversion rates and help you measure results to make better decisions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">LaunchBit CEO, Elizabeth Yin teamed up with Oli Gardner, Co-founder and Creative Director at <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> &#8211; the leading software in landing page builders &#8211; to hold a webinar for b2b marketers titled, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2yWILEyJoVo"><em>How to Create and Optimize High-Converting Landing Pages</em></a>. Here are some tips on how to create awesome landing pages that convert a lot of leads.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Increase conversions while lowering ad spend.</strong> You’re probably running ads on multiple sources or channels. If you’re going to be spending money on paid ads, you need to maximize those ad dollars and turn your traffic into more conversions on your landing pages. Creating and optimizing your landing pages allows you to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Give your audience only one choice.</strong> Almost all marketers make the mistake of offering too much choice on a landing page. You have one campaign and one goal &#8211; your landing page should reflect that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Respect the click.</strong> You need a very tightly connected experience between the source of your click (your ad) and the landing page experience after it. If you can master this, you’re going to be a more successful marketer and way ahead of your competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“You need the Topher Grace experience.” &#8211; Oli Gardner, Unbounce</p>
</blockquote>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Topher-Grace-experience.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5709" title="Topher Grace experience" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Topher-Grace-experience.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Leverage attention.</strong> As the attention ratio (number of links:number of calls to action) goes down, your conversion rates go up. Your campaign needs to be removed of all distractions that prevent your visitors from  converting. This brings focus to your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Have a compelling headline.</strong> People should be able to see a headline in an ad and see the same headline on your landing page.  And, it should be catchy &#8211; your headline is the first and most important step. Unbounce saw a 33% increase in their conversions when they matched their headlines.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6. Only split test if it’s worth your time.</strong> Figuring out if split testing is worth your time depends on your numbers. For example, if you get say a 5% increase in conversions after split testing you should determine the value of those additional conversions and determine if it&#8217;s worth the time it took you to split test.</p>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-to-split-tst.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5710" title="what to split tst" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-to-split-tst.png" alt="" /></a></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>7. Remember, most split tests yield nothing.</strong> Only 1 in 8 landing page split tests yield results, according to an experiment done by Appsumo. That means, on average, 7 split tests are thrown away. Be prepared to factor in the time you&#8217;ll spend on split tests that yield no results as well.</p>
