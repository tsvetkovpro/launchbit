		<description>It seems easy with this article, to be honest :) But I know it&#039;s not! SaaS has it own rules and there&#039;s a lot of testing before finding the best solution. But as you wrote, it&#039;s not impossible and there&#039;s a lot of things, tools and places which can help you with. For SaaS company in which I used to work, lead generaton worked the best. We were generating hot leads form social media with https://colibri.io or https://hootsuite.com and later just interact. Reaching to customers is just the most important. Of course, we all do want a scalable solution, but isn;t it a Holy Grail? Thanks again!</description>
