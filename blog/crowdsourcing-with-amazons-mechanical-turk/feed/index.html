		<description>Dear Josh, I think you have a lot of great things to say here. One question that I have is whether you have considered that some Evilaengcal Christians voted for President Obama? We are out here! Jesus is also our Lord and Savior. We just also happen to be glad that President Obama was reelected. Thanks for the work that you do.</description>

		<description>@Ed, thanks for your thoughts on Crowdflower.  Since we&#039;ve never used it ourselves, this is super helpful.  Do you know how the costs compare to say the cost of running the same job on Mechanical Turk multiple times?</description>

		<description>Nice write-up. Regarding Crowdflower: Crowdflower is a service that resides a level up from Mturk. They make it easier to run HITs, can automate the flow of HITs from RSS feeds, and other fun stuff. And, they have built out quality controls that may help you get the results you&#039;re looking for with less duplication of work. In some cases, that may be valuable. Yes, you&#039;ll pay a bit more for this, but it may be a better choice than coding more complex mturk interactions using the Mturk API.</description>

		<description>@Wendy, wow, this sounds like a topic for a whole new post!  Without knowing the details of what you are building, it sounds like this site isn&#039;t live yet, and you haven&#039;t yet validated the market?  (correct me if I&#039;m wrong)  To keep the user experience simple, I completely agree -- seems best to just have one payment system and pass the cost on to the seller.  I don&#039;t know what your business model is, but were you planning on charging the seller for selling on your site?  If so, then it doesn&#039;t seem like it would matter if you pass the cost on to the seller?  If you were not planning on charging sellers, then maybe you can take a loss on the 3% fee in the beginning while you are proving out the concept?  I don&#039;t know much about your product, but from the little I know, it sounds like the #1 thing you&#039;re trying to prove right now is whether people will come to your site and buy something -- anything.  And to get there, logistical details not related to the customer experience don&#039;t matter right now. I would be happy to talk with you in more detail over email -- feel free to drop me a note at hello@launchbit.com. cheers! :)</description>

		<description>This might be a different issues all together but I just want to throw it out there...We&#039;re running into an issue with our site.  If users select an item from seller #1 and another item from seller #2, and add both items to the shopping cart, the user needs to make two credit card transactions.  It&#039;s not possible for multiple sellers to receive a portion of a single credit card charge.  The only way to get around this is to have the credit cards processed by our credit card secured system (which cost us 2.8% process fee, and we have to charge our seller 3% just to cover the cost, obviously Amazon, eBay have much better % rate with the credit card company due to their huge volumes of transactions) and then the funds are distributed to each seller by using Pal pay mass distribution function.  It is such a painful way to do because, on daily basis we have to execute PayPal mass distribution and randomly check on it to make sure it is working properly.Originally we want to use Etsy.com model, each seller will deal with their own store/ merchandise and handle their own payment process in order to bypass/ avoid using our secured system and save some processing fee…its win win situation for both sides…since Pal pay does not charge any processing fee from account to account…or if they have their own credit card secured process account, they can absorbs their own processing fees.Our programmer is having hard time to figure out how to make it work without all these trouble (Etsy is able to do it, but according our programmer, they spend tons of time to develop their codes…and if we want to be lean start-up, we need to go with what we have for now and push our site live and work on the back end later to make improvement for 2.0 vision….Any suggestions?  Feedbacks?  My concern is to save the hustle, but most importantly to save seller money on the 3% process fee….</description>
