		<description>Hi Hoi -- good question.  Right, so while it is true that the user has not yet seen the inside of the emails prior to opening, we suspect that spam filters may ding your emails if you have too many images.  If these spam filters do ding your emails, then readers would not have a chance to open, thus causing a lower open rate.  

Thanks for sharing your results on your experiments around images vs CTR -- very interesting!</description>

		<description>Yep, in this case, the list was in the tens of thousands, so it led to a few hundred additional  clicks.</description>

		<description>Curious to know how email design for image ratio would effect open rates? Surely this would impact CTR rather than open since the user may not even open the email to see the different design. The impact on open rate would have to be on the long tail as users know what the design would be and would be less/more inclined to open it knowing that there are more/less images?

BTW, we&#039;ve done similar A/B tests and discovered, less images increase CTR. Open rates more influenced by subject line.</description>

		<description>I was curious about how significant a &lt;1% increase in CTR is. Would that be related to the total number of email recipients?</description>
