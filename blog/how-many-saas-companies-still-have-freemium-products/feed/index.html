		<description>Guys, make money online does not have to be diiffcult (I used to feel it did). I&#039;ll give you some advice right now. Look for a tutorial called Monezilax System (just google it). Seriously, I have earned crazy amounts of money with it. I probably shouldn&#039;t even be talking about it because I don&#039;t want a bunch of﻿ other folks out there running the same  game  but whatever, I am in a great mood today so I&#039;ll share the wealth haha.</description>

		<description>Hi Nelson -- thanks for reading this essay and for your comment!  There&#039;s a mix of companies in the data.  You can eyeball the companies by going to getapp.com and looking the featured pages.  

Agreed -- I think freemium was a lot more effective a couple years ago.  Unclear why but my speculation is that free is just no longer unique.</description>

		<description>Hello,

Very good article. The data you show is interesting.
I wonder how old are the companies that are offering a free plan. The newest or the oldest?
This may show a market shift in this type of marketing strategy.
Freemium was the dominant business model a couple of years ago. We may be facing a new marketing strategy as you said &quot;Near Free&quot;.
Have a great day!</description>
