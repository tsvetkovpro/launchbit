		<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I can’t remember how many conversations I&#8217;ve had with people about how they threw some money at paid advertising and then were severely disappointed when the results came back nil.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I can’t remember how many conversations I&#8217;ve had with people about how they threw some money at paid advertising and then were severely disappointed when the results came back nil.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/as-if.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5824" title="as if" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/as-if.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So I asked them, “Well, how much did you spend?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When their answers came back to me I was not surprised one bit that they had less than impressive results with their paid ad campaigns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One self-proclaimed b2b marketing pro responded, “I put $50 on the Facebook ad exchange and I got nothing.” Another said, “It was the worst $20 I’ve ever spent.” One hopeless soul even said she’d spent only $10 and was irate at the lack of clicks her ad received.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The truth is that you need to spend a significant amount on paid advertising for it to have an effect. Not only that, but it will also take time to optimize your campaigns.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So what’s a significant amount that will get you an impact?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, your end goal shouldn’t simply be to generate a lot of clicks. Your objective is to get people to sign up for your offer and eventually become a paying customer. So you first need to determine how much you can spend to obtain each new customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s how you do this….</p>
<p dir="ltr">Determine your the average lifetime value of your current customer by taking the total revenue collected over the past 12 months and divide by the number of customers or clients you have. If you have multiple revenue streams that vary widely, you may want to do <a href="http://www.cloudstrategies.biz/dont-be-a-customer-lifetime-value-simpleton/">weighted averages.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Your ultimate aim is most likely to acquire a new customer at <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">⅓ your average customer’s lifetime value</a>. So, if your average customer lifetime value is $3,000, then you will aim to spend $1,000 (⅓ of $3,000) to acquire a new customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s significantly higher than the $10 my hopeless friend tried on her paid ad campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clueless2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5826" title="clueless2" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clueless2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So $1,000, in this example, is also the minimum budget you need to determine if a particular paid ad channel is worthwhile, because this is how much it may take you to acquire a new customer.  By paid channel I mean an ad network like BuySellAds, an ad exchange like Facebook Ads, or a customer acquisition platform like LaunchBit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anything less will likely result in those nil results and you will end up wasting your money. Here’s <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-test-customer-acquisition-channels-for-value/">a 3-step process</a> to break it down for you even further.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why does the LaunchBit platform require a $1,000 minimum?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To answer this question for you, I reached out to our Co-founder and CTO, Jennifer Chin. Here’s what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“In order for an advertiser to determine whether a channel is a good fit, they need to have enough engagement in order to see a trend. Typically, they&#8217;re looking for some trend in conversion. Is the conversion rate high or low?  If a budget is too small, a marketer may not be able to generate enough clicks in order to confidently make a decision about whether we&#8217;re a good fit or not. And that just means they&#8217;ve wasted time, energy, and money to reach no conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Google has claimed you can start a campaign with just $5. How likely is that to give you an adequate picture of the results of any typical marketing channel?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Technically that’s true, and with only $5 maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and someone will convert right away. But regardless, you&#8217;ll have no idea whether the results you see are indicative of the marketing channel in the long run. If your boss asks whether you will commit 100% of your Q2 marketing budget to this channel based on a $5 test, what will you say?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Generally speaking, at LaunchBit, we don&#8217;t want our customers to waste their time, energy, and money, and we&#8217;re pretty certain that if they spend less than $1,000 on our platform, they&#8217;re not going to get definitive results about their campaigns.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>That makes sense, right? I’m sure you’re still wondering about ROI.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hitting performance goals is obviously important.  Performance marketers are looking for sales in their test campaigns, because that’s truly how to <a href="https://www.launchbit.com/new-campaign/%20">understand whether a certain paid channel</a> is worthwhile. Often a good proxy for this is the number and quality of leads you’re able to acquire from a channel with your $1,000 budget. Let’s say on average out of the 100 people that click on your ad, 25 of them <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-create-and-optimize-high-converting-landing-pages/">convert into a lead on your landing page</a>. You’ll need to know the average number of leads required in order to make one sale as well as the average number of landing page visitors to sign up for whatever your paid ad promised them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paid ad gets the clicks &gt; landing page converts to lead &gt; eventually becomes a sale</p>
<p dir="ltr">So let’s say that on average 1 out of those 25 leads become a sale. This means that you need at least 25 leads in order to get a sale. If you are spending $1,000 minimum budget and need at least 25 leads, your cost per lead can be roughly no more than $1,000/25 = $40 per lead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is your average cost per lead, and even with $1,000 budget it’s not ideal. You can do better, but you have to spend a significant amount of money to get significant results in order to make better decisions about your paid ad campaign and so you can stop wasting your money.</p>

<p>“Marketers regularly talk to us about their goals, and for many it boils down to one major theme: generating leads, and ultimately driving purchases.” <em>– Twitter Advertising (@TwitterAds)</em></p>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/launchbit"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5786" title="settings" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/settings-700x242.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>The Lead Generation Card makes it easy for users to express interest in what your brand offers. When someone expands your Tweet, they see a description of the offer and a call to action. The user simply clicks a button to send this information directly (and securely) to you. <strong>Learn how to set this up in 3 easy steps.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>
<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 1: Create your card</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">In your account settings, click Twitter ads and scroll over to the Creatives dropdown menu. This is where you create, modify, send, and track your Twitter cards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5787" title="5" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-700x298.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Card Content</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is where your card begins to come to life and Twitter makes it easy. Simply fill in the required fields with that clever b2b content rattling around in your head.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Short description:</strong> This where you tell your followers or other Twitter users what you’re offering or promoting. It’s what they received by clicking your call to action.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Card image:</strong> This is where you get to show off your creativity. This image will be shown to users as part of your card. It must be at least 600 pixels wide, and must have a width:height aspect ratio of 4:1. Consider this somewhat odd size before selecting a picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Call to action:</strong> This is where you get your followers or Twitter users to click. The call to action text is displayed on the button inside the card.</p>
<p dir="ltr">*Notice also that you can switch views from mobile to web to see how your card looks on multiple devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5788" title="2" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2-700x454.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You must also provide a link to your privacy policy on your site in order to use the Lead Generation card. All Twitter cards must include this link so users can see what data is being collected and how it&#8217;s being used. A simple copy and paste of the link to the  privacy policy on your company website should do the trick.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Fallback URL</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is the URL where (1) users can learn more about your offer after they sign up for your offer, and (2) users will be redirected to if they view the card on a non-supported platform, such as a third party Twitter client. This URL should point to a generic page on your site such as your homepage or a lead generation form that you host on your site. If your Twitter card is promoting a recent white paper, ideally you want them to show interest by clicking you call to action and you can follow up by sending it to them via email. The Fallback should only be a back up, not a page to obtain more information.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fallback1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5790" title="fallback" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fallback1-700x429.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Destination URL</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Adding a destination URL lets us redirect the user to your specified landing page after they submit the lead. This may act as a thank you page, and you can create a thank you message for this URL right in Twitter. This is optional and should not be used to obtain more information from your users.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Name Your Card</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Tell Twitter what you want to name your card. This won’t be visible to anyone but you or the managers of your Twitter Ads account. Agree to the terms and click ‘Create card.’</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/8.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5792" title="8" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/8-700x436.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 2: Tweet Your Card</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">Once you create your card, it will be listed in your Card Manager for you to access whenever you want. Just click the link <strong>Compose Tweet with this card.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">*Note that you can use your card multiple times for multiple tweets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You compose a tweet like any other tweet. Your Twitter card will take up 23 characters, so you only have 117 left to show you can hang with all the other clever b2b marketers out there and write something insanely catchy with the limited space you’re given.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Then you must choose how you want it delivered. This dictates not only how much you want to pay, but also who will see your Twitter card.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Standard:</strong> Delivered to only your twitter followers and no money spent. Your CPL is $0 for this one. If don’t want to spend your budget on paid Twitter cards, you can still create them and tweet them out on your own profile, but only your followers will see them. It acts as a normal tweet and the only increase in reach will be if your followers retweet your card.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Promoted only:</strong> Delivered to a targeted audience based on chosen keywords or hashtags; this is not delivered to your followers. You can pay to expand your reach – this is a part of the sponsored ads you often see spread across the social network. Surely, you’re likely to obtain more clicks with an expanded reach and key placement near the top of the feed.</p>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5793" title="10" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10-700x446.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Promotion</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is where you can select campaigns to promote this tweet. If you have previous paid Twitter Ad campaigns, you can attach your card to any of those campaigns.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Scheduling</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This one is obvious enough. Here, you can tweet now or schedule it for later.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Click ‘Tweet,’ then just go back to your Cards Manager to watch your numbers start rolling.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Step 3: Manage Your Leads</strong></h1>
<p dir="ltr">Every user you persuade to click your card becomes a lead. You can organize this lead information in one of two ways. If you have a CRM, you can integrate that with Twitter and the lead info will automatically populate your CRM. If you don’t have a CRM or you don’t want to integrate it with Twitter, the lead information is simply put into a downloadable list in Twitter.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>By setting up URL tracking to analyze and compare your blog content or various ad creatives and the different channels you place them in, you can measure the actions and behavior of your traffic and optimize your b2b marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>So how do you set up URL parameters? Keep scrolling…</p>
<p>For simplicity, I’m going to focus on setting up URL parameters for your blog posts, but keep in mind that this exact process can be used for any link you want to track, including ad creatives.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have two different blog posts.</p>
<p><strong>One has URL parameters. </strong>That means that when someone clicks on this link, that visit will be categorized by Google Analytics how you want this information organized &#8212; based on the referral data for this particular blog post.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-set-up-url-parameters-to-improve-your-b2b-marketing-campaign/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By setting up URL tracking to analyze and compare your blog content or various ad creatives and the different channels you place them in, you can measure the actions and behavior of your traffic and optimize your b2b marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>So how do you set up URL parameters? Keep scrolling…</p>
<p>For simplicity, I’m going to focus on setting up URL parameters for your blog posts, but keep in mind that this exact process can be used for any link you want to track, including ad creatives.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have two different blog posts.</p>
<p><strong>One has URL parameters. </strong>That means that when someone clicks on this link, that visit will be categorized by Google Analytics how you want this information organized &#8212; based on the referral data for this particular blog post.</p>
<p><strong>The other has no URL parameters. </strong>That means that while Google Analytics will attempt to classify traffic that comes from this source, it will not categorize the data how you specify. In general, GA does a good job of determining the source of traffic automatically, but I should point out that if you do NOT establish parameters for a URL you place in an email, GA will not be able to track it as coming from email. It will be labeled as ‘direct’ or not categorized at all. So it&#8217;s better to set up these URL parameters so that GA can collect the data you want and give you the analytics you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Teacher-Google-Analytics.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5744 alignnone" title="Teacher-Google-Analytics" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Teacher-Google-Analytics-700x542.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="542" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image credit: spinnaker.com</em></p>
<p><strong>Tell Google how you want to collect referral data</strong></p>
<p>URL parameters, or UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) tags allow you to add extra information to the link you create. This extra information appears in the Google Analytics reports under Traffic Sources. <strong>GA is so smart that it will recognize any parameter (UTM) you place after the question mark</strong> and automatically populate your account with exact words you tell it to.</p>
<p>There is a certain way to formulate these. For each new parameter, you need to add <strong>utm_medium=. </strong>This is how GA recognizes and organizes your traffic data. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>utm:</strong> you’re telling GA that you’re adding a parameter to the URL</p>
<p><strong>_medium=:</strong> this is a pre-established term in GA that tells it how to organize data</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the equal sign, type whatever word you want GA to call this parameter in your specific account for this specific blog. If you place this URL in an email, maybe you want to type in ‘email,’ or if you tweet this URL, maybe you want to type in ‘twitter,’ or ‘social.’ It’s completely up to you.</p>
<p>*Note that this is just one parameter. You will establish at least three per URL. Confused? Keep scrolling…</p>
<p>For instance, this is your original blog URL:</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin, simply place question mark at the end: ?</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/<strong>?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then establish your parameters: utm_source=social</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?<strong>utm_source=social</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to put a symbol in between new parameters: &amp;</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?utm_source=social<strong>&amp;utm_medium=twitter</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>By the time you’re done, the URL is very long:</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=why%20 your%20headline%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20hold%20my%20attention</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re asking yourself where the numbers and percentages came from, don’t worry.  I’ll explain in a second.</p>
<p>Ok, so you understand URL parameters (UTMs) and how they actually work to grab information in your various marketing channels. This is good. Now I’m going to tell you that there are great tools out there to make this easier.</p>
<p><strong>This best tool you can use</strong> for this is Google’s very own <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en">URL Builder</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/d1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5746 alignnone" title="d" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/d1-700x615.png" alt="" width="700" height="615" /></a></p>
<p>You can make the Source and Medium what you want, but to stay sane I chose a description for my blogs and then stuck with it. If I want to put my link in Twitter, I use ‘social’ for Source and ‘twitter’ for Medium. I put ‘blog’ in the Content field since I haven’t specified this in any other field yet. The Term field is for you to specify your paid keywords, but not necessary since I’m not paying to promote this blog.</p>
<p>*Note that I always use lowercase so GA doesn’t group things in ways I don’t want.</p>
<p>The Campaign Name is what I use most often, so I just copy and paste the title of my blog into this field in the URL builder. This is the first thing GA displays to me when I click Campaigns.</p>
<p>*Note that the URL Builder adds %20 for spaces and GA adds dashes. So if I copy and paste the blog title, <em>Why your headline doesn’t hold my attention</em> into the Campaign Name, the new URL (with parameters) will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-your-headline-doesnt-hold-my-attention/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=<strong>why %20your%20headline%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20hold%20my%20attention</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Google Analytics the Campaign will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GA224.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="GA22" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GA224.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>But you can go deeper</strong></p>
<p>It’s smart to use as many fields as you can in the URL builder. It helps you go deeper and get a better idea of where exactly your traffic is coming from and which content they like. The actual URL is not going to display in GA (not the original and not the tagged URL), so you need to add the right information in the right field so that it displays correctly in GA.</p>
<p>This can get complicated. You’ll want to use the same field descriptions for the same types of content so that GA can lump them together. You don’t want something like this to show up Google Analytics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7b.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5748 alignnone" title="7b" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7b-700x101.png" alt="" width="700" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>These are all going to the same blog actually. This was back in my amateur days. Mistake 1 was that I made the Campaign Name two different things (e.g. blog ad blog7). Mistake 2 was that I didn’t consider the fact that GA default settings take into consideration capital letters (e.g. Blog and blog). So even though they are the same thing, one has a capital so GA thinks they are different. I’m all for learning by doing, but it can cause some headaches.</p>
<p><strong>A spreadsheet is great way to keep yourself organized. </strong></p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/xls1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5751 alignnone" title="xls" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/xls1-700x185.png" alt="" width="700" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember to set up parameters for each channel</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need a different URL with different parameters for each channel (as pictured above), but all these parameters link back to the same blog post so you know where traffic came from for each blog post.</p>
<p>Do this correctly, and you’ll be in a better position to determine where your traffic came from so you can place your blogs, ads, or any content you have in the proper channels and optimize your b2b campaign.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. The headline</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The<a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/why-headlines-are-the-most-important-landing-page-element-to-split-test/"> headline is the most important thing</a> to split test. Ask yourself, is your primary headline phrased to answer the question “What is this page about?”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://unbounce.com/author/michael-aagaard/">Michael Aagaard</a>, self-confessed split test junkie and copywriting fanatic, conducted <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/5-landing-page-headline-formulas-tested/">3 case studies</a> with an accumulated sample size of a little over 50.000 visitors. He was able to see an overall pattern in the results. When doing landing page headline tests, a clear headline that focuses on a benefit generally performs best. While super creative headlines might be the right approach for offline marketing, the results of the studies show very little data indicating that this assumption holds true in the world of online marketing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Aagaard goes on to say that he “has yet to see a creative headline beat a clear headline in an A/B test.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, the clear (perhaps boring) headline outperformed the creative (a.k.a. sexy) headline and sold <strong>38.46% more memberships.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-headlines.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5726 aligncenter" title="5 things headlines" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-headlines.png" alt="" width="353" height="288" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Images</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Are you using a relevant and original main image that shows whatever you offer being used? Images are important because they reinforce what it is that you’re offering and help persuade your visitors to take action. You should aim to have your images link with your unique value proposition and main message. Hawk Host<a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/02/21/multivariate-testing-a-real-life-example/"> A/B tested their image</a> and saw that the <strong>padlock converted 2-3x better than the original.</strong> The padlock provided visitors with a message of security (much more so than the image of the globe).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-image.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5727" title="5 things image" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-image.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Form and call to action placement</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you make it clear what your visitors will receive by clicking your call to action? Is it in a prominent location on your page? <a href="http://www.measuredsem.com/">MeasuredSEM</a> tested the location of their landing page form and call to action. They had the same exact offer/CTA that lived at the end of the sales copy on an SEO landing page and repeated it again above the fold. This gave visitors the option of<a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing#."> converting sooner vs later</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“If users are ready to convert, don&#8217;t make them wait b/c you may lose them.” – <a href="http://www.ken-lyons.com/">Ken Lyons</a>, Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.measuredsem.com/">MeasuredSEM</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Location is key, but <strong>you should also try button size.</strong> Shawn Livengood is the Online Marketing Manager for BuildASign.com; he did a lot of tests on the text content and images, and<a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing#."> nothing really moved the dial</a>.  But then, he made the button bigger and saw a huge lift. So then he made the button bigger still. Another success! A good rule of thumb is to make the CTA large enough to stand out<a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/checklist/"> from 6ft away</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-button-size.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5731" title="5 things button size" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-button-size.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>But what about testing button color?</strong> Testing button color should not be on your list of things to test. Placement of form/cta is most important, followed by button size, not color. It should be obvious that your button should stand out from the rest and attract visitors eyes, but time should not be spent testing this. We agree with landing page guru Oli Gardner when he says, <em>“Testing button color is overrated, it’s all about contrast.”</em> Accomplish this and you’re visitors are far more likely to convert.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Quotes and customer testimonies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you provide examples of previous customers using or complementing your product/service? 37signals changed the design of their page by adding a picture of a person and a testimony. It <strong>increased signups by 102.5%</strong>. The type of background<a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final"> with a person really sticks out</a> from most of the other pages on the internet. It may signal to the visitor the importance of the website and make them want to read more of the offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are getting people to sign up for a webinar, a good idea is to show number of registrants and customer testimonials as social proof. WikiJob had<a href="http://www.salesnexus.com/blog/the-importance-of-using-testimonials"> three testimonials</a> on their page and saw a <strong>34% increases in conversions.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-testimonials.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5730" title="5 things testimonials" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-testimonials.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Copy text</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Have you tested using a short page vs. a long page to understand how much information your visitors need to convert? Let’s go back to 37 signals. They  tried long copy on their Highrise page with the same background vs short copy. The<a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final"> long page performed worse</a>; 22.72% worse, actually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Remove 50% of the copy, then delete half of what’s left.” &#8211; Steven Krug, Information architect and user experience professional.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-length1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738" title="5 things length" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5-things-length1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you use bullet points to describe the benefits of your product/service? Using bullet points on your landing page is very important. They help synthesize compelling information and make it very easy for someone to quickly skim the landing page. ContentVerve.com <a href="http://contentverve.com/online-copywriting-case-studies-with-examples/">conducted an experiment </a>where they tested completely generic form copy against a version where they added a few bullets. The form with the <strong>bullets received 83.75% more newsletter sign-ups.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The above are good examples of what other companies have done to increase conversions. Realize that testing your landing pages can move the needle for your marketing campaigns, but don’t let all the data and numbers overwhelm you, and don’t complicate it. This<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/test-landing-pages-for-maximum-conversions/"> shouldn&#8217;t stifle your creativity</a>, but rather should be another tool to optimize your conversion rates and help you measure results to make better decisions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">LaunchBit CEO, Elizabeth Yin teamed up with Oli Gardner, Co-founder and Creative Director at <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> &#8211; the leading software in landing page builders &#8211; to hold a webinar for b2b marketers titled, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2yWILEyJoVo"><em>How to Create and Optimize High-Converting Landing Pages</em></a>. Here are some tips on how to create awesome landing pages that convert a lot of leads.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Increase conversions while lowering ad spend.</strong> You’re probably running ads on multiple sources or channels. If you’re going to be spending money on paid ads, you need to maximize those ad dollars and turn your traffic into more conversions on your landing pages. Creating and optimizing your landing pages allows you to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Give your audience only one choice.</strong> Almost all marketers make the mistake of offering too much choice on a landing page. You have one campaign and one goal &#8211; your landing page should reflect that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Respect the click.</strong> You need a very tightly connected experience between the source of your click (your ad) and the landing page experience after it. If you can master this, you’re going to be a more successful marketer and way ahead of your competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“You need the Topher Grace experience.” &#8211; Oli Gardner, Unbounce</p>
</blockquote>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Topher-Grace-experience.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5709" title="Topher Grace experience" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Topher-Grace-experience.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Leverage attention.</strong> As the attention ratio (number of links:number of calls to action) goes down, your conversion rates go up. Your campaign needs to be removed of all distractions that prevent your visitors from  converting. This brings focus to your landing page.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Have a compelling headline.</strong> People should be able to see a headline in an ad and see the same headline on your landing page.  And, it should be catchy &#8211; your headline is the first and most important step. Unbounce saw a 33% increase in their conversions when they matched their headlines.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6. Only split test if it’s worth your time.</strong> Figuring out if split testing is worth your time depends on your numbers. For example, if you get say a 5% increase in conversions after split testing you should determine the value of those additional conversions and determine if it&#8217;s worth the time it took you to split test.</p>
<div> <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-to-split-tst.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5710" title="what to split tst" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-to-split-tst.png" alt="" /></a></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>7. Remember, most split tests yield nothing.</strong> Only 1 in 8 landing page split tests yield results, according to an experiment done by Appsumo. That means, on average, 7 split tests are thrown away. Be prepared to factor in the time you&#8217;ll spend on split tests that yield no results as well.</p>

China declared its Internet &quot;open&quot; on January 14 but defended censorship that has prompted Web giant Google to threaten to pull out of the country, sparking a potential new irritant in China-US relations. China employs a vast system of Web censorship dubbed the &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot; that blocks content such as political dissent, pornography and other information viewed as objectionable and the issue looks likely to shape up as the latest addition to a growing list of disputes between China and the United States over trade, climate change and human rights.

</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">But, it takes a lot of time and effort trying to come up with interesting stuff that your prospects and customers would actually want to read. This is why you must make sure you pick relevant topics that are continually growing in popularity.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Enter Google Trends</a>. <strong>81% of B2B buyers start with a <a href="http://www.iconsive.com/inbound-marketing-blog/21-b2b-marketing-statistics-that-will-blow-your-mind?hsCtaTracking=b5e6eb9e-e514-485d-bada-4d99929d8907%7C3c29b794-b11a-4783-ba64-8dea99dffcde&amp;utm_content=12101714&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8wFYiz3dTFx9pE4nCnVrEJoMgCMVfb0200rK639twjpflz_hQYwHZDe049qwdpOrrwgP8M1EXi45s2ZJTomN6n6gp6sA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;_hsmi=12101714">web search</a></strong>, and Google Trends does a great job of showing how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world. It paints a pretty good picture of what kinds of content people are interested in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Andrew Chen, Writer and Entrepreneur, describes Google Trends “as a great tool and a fantastic way to see if the pull demand is increasing or decreasing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">As a SaaS marketer, you should be familiar with <em>growing trends</em> so you can be sure to include them in your writing. Not only that, but you should also be familiar with<em> fading trends</em> so you’ll know better than to spend any significant amount of time creating your blog content around those topics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take a look at some keywords relevant to the b2b SaaS industry and determine if they are worth spending any amount of time on.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Content Marketing,”</strong> as a term, is an obvious first example. Clearly, it’s growing in popularity and importance as more and more b2b marketers are writing about it. Interest in it has been pretty solid even well before 2007 , but in the past couple years (blue line) it has really increased its presence in Google’s indexed content. Looking only in the past 60 days (red line), it has been steadily increasing with the occasional spike in searches.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Qg_E221qxte9NoV8n2iQfgJLmGv6s7jmDr8raLenxOmf4ZSRYNtgqe0xR6LKO0TTfwXsh2QBTRqITEg33hIqi-B_4TmhKUxCo1yldEdPevKTiQOdhDpVXWgohDB2cw" alt="search content marketing.png" width="624px;" height="228px;" /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K2qObtuRqUsAu7JxedFDAw482KDdUryAIOmiUSTI1s2QJyZPmQQ7KsYFxGeBiK7jKqQW7lxP5t3HUCgnztZthCdnhomBoL62p-hPmXbkqPwKkflZw9FL1J8XW3MpUA" alt="60 days content marketing.png" width="624px;" height="223px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Audience Targeting”</strong> really skyrocketed in late 2007 and any company that was writing about the topic was relevant in the minds of their prospects, customers, and anyone in their respective industry. It has maintained its relevance since late 2007 (blue line) and is still a worthy topic to wrap your blog content around. In the past 60 days (red line) it has shown some real growth as more and more people are still plugging the term into their Google browser.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1W8SCaJj-JUGIvUli8erKN1rNiFfgbfy7b42snt7GObjrZR-syFqalEb1-ISlQBbn6ezDubqExMIecMsc_uoKyOg4guHaaU2kvU0JZ7iNCmjlIbv24tkYuF8GC3f3g" alt="search audience targeting.png" width="624px;" height="233px;" /><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Eg99xlnCmsxYgx6cg1Y48Zzn18qf10IEgZSmMR_hz4PQ2h5hqgpy3bCzX1SA-dzz9-O18IIO8bxaXYnHxkiZ4EHf09Xcr0sFiasY0Jijgc03_hMEYLw4DkiDThaZmg" alt="60 days audiencce targeting.png" width="624px;" height="219px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Landing Pages”</strong> has always been relevant to companies who want to capture lead information. It appears that landing pages are more important than ever and show no sign of fading, both in the long term and the short term.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ikgePI_ipKQchFZD3bsrCUSJrtJG58rDUoGINYyDChTNPBMBaxQ-KezCTrHEkJixBFqDVuwm55mo56cNoPV-A_YdExF5HwRhbrnUCOavsGGoXLHZyR8sDDyL2n2Pw" alt="search landing pages.png" width="624px;" height="219px;" /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6UvnUWnHudtQt5ZD1rXFC8w-qws8rK4CNokxbm8I6Fst3WzlmPM4txjOL3quGzPRNZwZFQw6uhxMUZPntoeC8IkZSDKC4JlVc1zZW1V9o-eA5kZu6fBXBHLDqjdq0A" alt="60 days landing pages.png" width="624px;" height="233px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Lead Generation”</strong> was once the holy grail of online business. People wanted any and every piece of information they could find about how to improve their own efforts. This one is tricky, though. Searches for this term have held steady over the past 5 or 6 years (blue line), but it appears to be a fading search term. If you look short term, however, in the past 60 days (red line) it has a significant increase in activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q8AI-vhMOV1AQda5rx3sGBcgwHYyJ0sZFH5J3clB47C7eM5Q6LAc4yeEjb71DoOyOaNE2u48s_ZKxpgrQ6FgZRdCLTCLr7CqWdPXk4fpegHegnuvtK4OYY13ymtNQ" alt="search lead generation.png" width="624px;" height="227px;" /><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BN57xB5PLHBH3tV3tAMmmBni5vjJKEOHERz_FrF0HLsnSMhVzXF88qD3AzV9yv1aIcjsQXcjE1SeLDGLHVlNGPnBD0j0mJ3nipXl05r4i5R2ZNPQJPCD9L4vmMA4sg" alt="60 days lead gen.png" width="624px;" height="225px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Growth Hacking”</strong> is on the up. Rich Roll’s<a href="https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/7f838b1fa228"> latest writing spree</a> on the hippest new blogging medium, @Medium, speaks on the rise of this ‘hacking’ term and what the trending topic means. “Go ahead and Google any deprivation of the term [hack] and see what comes up. It’s amazing, actually. Consistent with our shrinking attention span and demand for immediate gratification, the hack trend is emblematic of our obsessive modern imperative for immediacy.” Enough said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tYH3OlvblXM81VOoKIAYIYVVYmGiPhbQ7C1Tw6fqQwmQj0nr-DHmmjSvqH-4ESyGPn_kip9ZqLwIuNs_2vkEzCw9kZk2GlScKfr15GrkshYSngHt9rzctWIOvrjU6g" alt="search growth hacking.png" width="624px;" height="232px;" /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N0LHHw2KZ6GVg4q7cFghAI6kFDg4a6IEHKBS6Bf3FZd_uWtQhYkudY-giH3ijBop-GT06LxSZPLgVevVikoGeaT1c68YJUVXeD6bs590Bi2rSBwSKWB7DqUEkZlrAQ" alt="60 days growth hacking.png" width="624px;" height="224px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Outbound Marketing”</strong> surprisingly is still thriving in the Google search box. You would think that with the rise of b2b inbound marketing, outbound marketing would become less and less relevant – and maybe that’s true as far as actual implementation (maybe not) – either way, people are talking about it so you should be writing about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mpcebit3fnfiBmXCbRo4Cc2ube4RCHPDhI__gsx75BKtYCW6-nXfQwnfRX9RuGCCAmjLM3LeKdb0TK_pa_EYYw6hfbluk58wUPpEr4Lksd5TBfgu8NHf-I5_H8yTkA" alt="search outbound marketing.png" width="624px;" height="227px;" /><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hAn-6gs1IaosCu2p5motNd5lNTnqKtY7tIpbLzC5MoarN4zYpMom4GIuder0X-W1fF2-QP9T0BjhVcbaTzaZuRy0btlJZeo2Po1-_Ylg2GT0HXtTmc3JsCPzxFGEYw" alt="60 days outbound marketing.png" width="624px;" height="231px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>“Inbound Marketing”</strong> is without a doubt increasing &#8211; along with it’s implementation by SaaS companies all over the world. This topic is on the minds of marketers everywhere and the growing trend supports this, both short term and long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/udErQ0zyJvx1FEn77LAkdPaDn674WEvHqY20qksS2atQV1pABr01-1S0z64oGTSfrWm4ZbzFRvYSZAix8M5fqKnhu1QsshU22frgrX7uqqBq7Vb4cymw5aRT5pnKCg" alt="search inbounce marketing.png" width="624px;" height="229px;" /><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/V3jvuy8qTL6y15XteYRdCnUnW50Jcp3Dd2TArEg0YHU6XD8fJYM797Odpy-soUSddyNJRII4GsD5XXVKjzwXQDkOuD--O8F9D6BTiWu3esWt2tun3JyqCvIg68tbCw" alt="60 days inbound marketing.png" width="624px;" height="231px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to know what kinds of content people find interesting, use Google Trends to search keywords most relevant to your customers or your target audience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A caveat to using such a simple tool is that mobile apps don’t often benefit from search engine traffic the same way that websites do, since none of the content in the apps are being indexed – which means the trends in Google will not display mobile traffic. Thus, remember that this analysis is strongest for content searched on the web, and to think of this as good starting point for developing your blog content and topics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jonathan Abrams, Founder of Friendster, says “the sad truth about blogging is that 99% of of them are not worth reading.” <strong>Don’t be one of those blogs. Stay relevant.</strong></p>

<p>The devil walks into a bar and sits at a table with eight newspaper and magazine publishers plus one strange little fellow in shabby, dated robes. The devil says, &#8220;How&#8217;d you all like to get some advertising revenue at higher rates than what you&#8217;ve been fetching for the past five or six years?&#8221; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/25/yahoo-opens-gemini-native-advertising">Read more…</a></p>

<h1>The Bloombergization of Online Advertising</h1>

<p>Naturally, the right data in the hands of such advertisers can provide an edge over the competition—and many believe it is headed toward a reality in the online ad business where, not unlike Wall Street, the instantaneous analysis of performance and behavior drives results. <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/bloombergization-online-advertising-155884">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
