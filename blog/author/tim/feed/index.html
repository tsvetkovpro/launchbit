<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pic-collage.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4818" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;" title="pic-collage" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pic-collage-250x270.png" alt="pic collage" width="250" height="270" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">When I was first introduced to the concept of SEO, I thought about it in relation to websites and blogs. Marketers know that it’s crucial to use keywords, tags, and titles to boost their pages on search engines like Google. What I didn’t realize was that the same rules apply to app stores with app store SEO, or “app store optimization.”</p>
<p>As of June, Apple’s app store had over 900,000 apps. And last year, research firm Canalys <a href="http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/top-app-stores-risk-losing-control-app-discovery">estimated</a> that up to two-thirds of the apps in leading app stores get fewer than 1,000 downloads in their first year.</p>
<p><a href="http://cardinalblue.com/">Cardinal Blue</a> saw this trend firsthand, publishing a few apps to iTunes that didn’t get amazing traction. But then they created <a href="http://pic-collage.com/">PicCollage</a>, a photo app that grew to 14 million downloads and 5.3 million active users.</p>
<p>In this interview with cofounder Ching-Mei Chen, she tells us about how they optimized for the app store, what factors affect your ranking, and why you should update often.</p>
<p><strong>What happened on day one? Did you do any marketing?</strong></p>
<p>We were shocked to be featured as new and noteworthy by Apple. We didn&#8217;t talk to anyone from Apple or the press. We can only guess it was picked up because of its simplicity and that it showed off the touch interface. Back then you could only pool multiple photos into one area of the screen, but it had no other features like saving a collage or sharing it. Apple likes simplicity, I think. It was so simple, it couldn&#8217;t be poorly designed.</p>
<p>It only got featured for one week and got bumped up into the top 10 of photo apps; and now it&#8217;s been 18 months and we haven&#8217;t been knocked out of the top 20 since. The competition is getting crazy, and we haven&#8217;t spent any marketing money yet.</p>
<p><strong>After being featured, what did you do to maintain that growth?</strong></p>
<p>I think a big part of it is user experience – being bug free, and the user knowing what to do within the first five seconds. That&#8217;s why our interface is really simple, and the motions are really intuitive. One thing that definitely makes a difference is SEO. We use different terms every version to see which work best.</p>
<p><strong>What are you altering?</strong></p>
<p>They scrape descriptions, and the reviews. We change the description&#8217;s keywords. There&#8217;s also keyword search terms that you can change with each revision. We tried keywords like “Justin Bieber,” too, and we scored pretty high, actually. The only other variables are the screenshots. You have to make sure people love you, and write good reviews for you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you prompt people to write reviews?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but we have to avoid being spammy. Every third time an active user comes into the app, we ask them to leave a review. The other thing we did – I think the way we phrase it is “Do you love PicCollage?” and they&#8217;re asked to either write a review saying how they love it, or write feedback on what to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Does Apple check for relevancy in keywords?</strong></p>
<p>No. Only titles, and if someone complains. Apparently, now, you can&#8217;t put the name of another app in your title. Also, if your icon is too similar and someone complains. Also, if it infringes copyright, or if it&#8217;s an obvious direct copy of another program, it gets taken out.</p>
<p><strong>How often did you publish updates?</strong></p>
<p>We had a newer version in the queue immediately as Apple released the previous version, so about one-week development cycles. That&#8217;s not how we do it now because the program is code-wise a lot more complicated, with more menus, etc. We kind of lost sight of the big picture as we were trying to turn out things we needed to get in there as soon as possible, like sharing and saving. Trying to figure out a roadmap for the product took more time. Now we generally have two submissions per month. We were initially advised to not put out too many updates, but I think it keeps the program fresh in users&#8217; minds and makes it look like it&#8217;s being maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Does updating boost your visibility in the store?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. Each update resets your stars to the all-time average, but you can still read previous reviews. Currently we have five stars, but if we pushed out a new version, it would go back to 4.5 stars. As we get more reviews, it goes back to that 4.5-star equilibrium anyway.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://pic-collage.com/">PicCollage</a> is now available on iOS and Android platforms. If you haven’t tried it out, you should definitely download it. It’s easy to use, and a fun way to create picture collages!</em></p>

<p>We have all tested out different marketing channels to see which bring in the most customers &#8211; from email to Facebook and Google ads to special promotions. But how do you tell if a new marketing channel is working? Is it quality or quantity that counts? When should you spend money?</p>
<p>After sharing how Listia <a title="How to lure in early customers" href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-lure-in-early-customers/">lured in their initial customers</a>, cofounder James Fong answered these questions and more below.</p>
<p><strong>Listia has tested out a variety of social sharing strategies. How do you know if they’re working or not?</strong></p>
<p>For us, we’re very metrics-driven. We have graphs and statistics, on everything. We try new things and look to see what sticks. You want to know: do they use [your product] as you’re bringing them in? Are they valuable? Do they stick around? Do they retain better? Are they a better-quality user?</p>
<p>You can track that all via their engagement within the site. So when we do have a different strategy or we do try something new, we always look at the statistics, especially if it’s costing us money. Even if it’s not costing us money, we’re constantly looking at the metric behind it.</p>
<p><strong>How should entrepreneurs start testing marketing channels? What should their thought process be?</strong></p>
<p>These days, it’s really easy. It’s really cheap to run an experiment and see if that’s a possible source of users for your business. You don’t have to spend thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to do that.</p>
<p>I would just go for whatever is the biggest bang for your buck. Know what you’re looking for and be sure to realize what you are spending your money on. Figure out which one works best, depending on your financial situation. Some people can afford to pay for a Super Bowl commercial or put a big billboard on [Highway] 101. But if you can’t, there are actually some cheaper alternatives that you can try out. Just try a bunch of different things and then see what works best.</p>
<p>That’s the great benefit of being in a startup: you can do those things relatively quickly and just try things out as fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>As you get a feel for your audience, what kind of marketing really speaks to them?</strong></p>
<p>Our user base consists of a wide variety of users. It’s male, female. It’s 20-year-olds, 50-year-olds, 80-year-olds. We have all types of people, so there isn’t really one channel that works best. I think for us, actually, the organic channel or organic referral channel works the best. The obvious reason is that the users are prequalified; they’ve come in through one of their friends that suggested the site. Those users usually turn out the best.</p>
<p>Our second source is we do run Facebook and Google ads. Those turn out to be okay as well, but we do think the best are probably organic users that come in.</p>
<p><strong>How do you improve your marketing techniques for Facebook and Google ads?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always checking the metrics on what’s working or not. You can tweak your ad as much as you want to get as many users. Get a ton of users, and then the users can be completely garbage. So you always match up the metrics behind the ad that you are placing and keep track of what type of user is coming in via certain or different channels. You want to bring in the highest-quality users possible. So in short, it’s a very simple metric system, in terms of tweaking the ads. It’s just playing with words here and there.</p>
<p><strong>You talk about Facebook for referrals. Can you offer tips or tricks on how to use that effectively?</strong></p>
<p>I think <a title="listia incentivation" href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/15/future-of-sharing-facebook-twitter-google/">incentivization is the key to our sharing mechanism</a>. When you are incentivized to do something, you’re going to do it. It’s not too often that I just want to share something or tweet something out of the blue, so with us, we incentivize our users to share with the virtual currency.</p>
<p>Our users also share their items because they want more eyeballs on their items. They want more people in the marketplace because the more people you have in the marketplace, the healthier it is. So just like I said before, it just has to make sense and has to be built into the product from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Those days are over. Today, NFC (near field communication) is an innovative way to collect, qualify, and interact with potential leads from events and conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Case study: Tasting Table</strong></p>
<p>Last summer, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/17/nfc-tasting-table/">Tasting Table held their annual Lobster Roll Rumble</a>. The competition pitted around 20 lobster roll makers against each other to create the best crustacean-filled bun.</p>
<p>In the past, Tasting Table had used paper ballots for attendees to cast their votes. But tallying votes manually had been a hassle, so they used <a href="http://www.tagstand.com/">Tagstand</a> to add NFC to the voting. Attendees were given wristbands, and they could vote by swiping their wrist on an NFC reader near their favorite delectable treat.</p>
<p>It was a hit. And, an amazing 90%+ voted.</p>
<p>Even better, Tasting Table received a wealth of data. Besides voting, attendees could use the NFC bracelets to post their thoughts to Facebook and Twitter, like “Speedy check-in at the Lobster Roll Rumble!” or “Need more drink options.”</p>
<p>These data provided some insight into what attendees loved (and didn’t love). They could even slice and dice segments within their larger attendee pool to craft more targeted communications later. For example, they could send the most active and engaged attendees special invitations to other hi-tech tasting events.</p>
<p><strong>Your turn</strong></p>
<p>NFC technology lets you capture leads and granular information about them.  As you plan your next event, think about how you could use this technology to learn more about your prospective customers. Could NFC allow attendees to subscribe to your newsletter, enter a raffle, or get on the waiting list for your product? Whatever you choose, it sure beats sifting through business cards.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Pricing is difficult &#8211; a quandary to every marketer. Charge too high, and you scare customers away. But charge too low, and you leave who-knows-how-much money on the table.</p>
<p>I recently read a post by writer and <a href="http://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> founder Nathan Barry on how his <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html">ebook generated nearly $100K in revenue</a>. I was blown away by the four simple pricing techniques he used.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Pricing is difficult &#8211; a quandary to every marketer. Charge too high, and you scare customers away. But charge too low, and you leave who-knows-how-much money on the table.</p>
<p>I recently read a post by writer and <a href="http://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> founder Nathan Barry on how his <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html">ebook generated nearly $100K in revenue</a>. I was blown away by the four simple pricing techniques he used.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pricing-image.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4722" title="pricing-image" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pricing-image-250x132.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>1. Price high</strong></p>
<p>Many marketers are afraid to charge high prices. Customers complain. Few people buy. And yet, there are some serious benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fewer support requests</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Higher-quality customers with deeper pockets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having fewer support requests obviously saves you time, which equals money. And higher-quality customers may offer you better feedback, refer you to their high-quality friends, and stay loyal.</p>
<p>So how does Barry decide whether to double the price of his product? He asks himself if he would lose more than half the sales. “If the answer is no, then I double the price,” Barry explains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bundling</strong></p>
<p>Instead of selling just an ebook, Barry decided to bundle his ebook with other products, like Photoshop files and videos. Some of his customers would then buy higher-priced packages on an impulse, earning him incremental revenue.</p>
<p>If you’re selling a product, consider whether you can break it down into different bundles. That’ll create cheaper options for those customers who are scared by high price tags and who would otherwise say no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>3. Anchors and decoys</strong></p>
<p>More importantly, the prices for those extra bundles play a critical role. When people are shopping, they tend to compare options: “Why should I buy an ebook for $39 when most ebooks cost $9?” But by offering different packages, you shift their thinking or their “anchor”: “Should I buy the ebook for $39, the ebook plus videos for $79, or the whole package for $169?” In comparison, $39 suddenly looks very reasonable.</p>
<p>Bundles can also be decoys. Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist, often cites an experiment where a <a href="http://interaction-dynamics.com/blog/2009/12/decoy-pricing-how-to-make-consumers-choose-the-product-you-want-to-sell/">decoy bundle</a> is offered; it’s a decoy because it has a similar cost to the most expensive package but far fewer features. As he’s shown, this increases the number of people who end up purchasing the most expensive plan.</p>
<p><strong>4. Urgency</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, Barry created urgency. He offered a 25% discount for all sales on the first day of his ebook launch. And within the first 48 hours, he had already made nearly $20K.</p>
<p>With physical goods, we often create urgency by hinting that the product is going to sell out &#8211; think about Amazon’s “5 left in stock” or infomercials’ constant refrain of “while supplies last.” But in the digital world, urgency comes from prices or extra perks. Kickstarter products regularly feature early-bird specials, and thousands of apps go on sale for the holidays. Limited discounts are an effective way to expedite sales.</p>

<p><small><em>Image from <a href="http://www.orissajenkins.com">Orissa Jenkins</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong>Who is your audience and what kind of marketing speaks to them?</strong></p>
<p>Our core market is entrepreneurs. Within that there are obviously people that identify themselves as small business owners, but still as entrepreneurs. They are still very much a consumer-type buyer.</p>
<p><strong>What are some common mistakes people make related to their audience?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, not knowing their market. We made this mistake when we started; we marketed to entrepreneurs, small businesses, and home-based businesses, and we had no permanent message. Obviously, you’ve got to test some things out and figure out where the market is, so it wasn’t a mistake necessarily. We spent too long doing it and we didn’t focus quick enough. But once we started focusing on where entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurship market was, our results were much better. I think people go way too broad and stay broad for too long because they don’t understand and know their market.</p>
<p>I think the other mistake a lot of startups make is that there is always talk of free marketing and blogging. Obviously, you should do all of these things and we do do that, but you have to combine it with paid advertising. A lot of people just ignore that because there’s always buzz about all these super-successful companies that never spent money on advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have some tips or tricks about how to figure out who your audience is and reach out to them?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is that you’ve got to be talking to the customers who paid you money and ignore the people who are free customers or say “I like your idea” or “it sounds good.” Talk to the people who’ve stepped up and given you money. See where they are and how they identify, understand their businesses and their verticals, and see what you can learn from that data.</p>
<p>We spent way too much time on free customers with <a href="http://chargify.com/">Chargify</a> [which Hauser cofounded] and other businesses. We never had free customers with Grasshopper. You know [free] customers were distractions and ultimately never wanted to pay us because the type of customer they were. We shouldn’t have been listening to their feedback on features or the type of customers they were because we didn’t want them.</p>
<p><em>Are you listening to your customers? Are you listening to the right people?</em></p>

<p><small><i>Image by <a href="http://www.orissajenkins.com">Orissa Jenkins</a></i></small></p>
<p><strong>1. Segmenting their audience</strong></p>
<p>By segmenting their audience, MixRank was able to drill down to get a very well-defined group. This helped narrow the scope of the problem they were trying to solve.</p>
<p><strong>2. Paying for market research</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Right away, MixRank started spending $2,000 per month on Google Adwords. They viewed it not as a risk, but as a way to learn what people wanted. In addition, it helped them determine their costs for customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creating content their audience will respond to</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having narrowed their focus, MixRank was able to select content that would engage their target audience. Whether it was trying to break news, reach out to bloggers, or post on a social bookmarking site, they would include a sign up invitation for lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Offering free services</strong></p>
<p>Spending $2k/mo (of money that was tough to come by) and offering free services doesn&#8217;t sound like a great business plan. However, these were the strategies MixRank used to gain valuable insight on the market. Specifically, they built marketing campaigns and did free consulting for people willing to talk to them so they could figure out exactly what their problems were. In addition, they now had a list of people that &#8216;owed them a favor&#8217; and who were more likely to be responsive to requests later on. All it cost them was time, which was something they had a lot more of than money!</p>
<p><strong>5. Being patient</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MixRank didn&#8217;t dismiss campaigns that didn&#8217;t yield immediate results. Particularly for Saas products, potential customers need time to play with it before deciding to buy. They use, as a rule of thumb, to get at least 30 conversions before determining what the conversion rate for the campaign is.</p>
<p><strong>6. Running Facebook ads</strong></p>
<p>Remember the $2k/mo on Google Adwords? It&#8217;s difficult to keep going at that pace, especially for B2B/Saas businesses. There&#8217;s typically not thousands of keywords to bid on and competing against big enterprise software companies that are spending millions tend to be fruitless. With Facebook ads, it is easier to drill down to the target audience and the competition was/is generally local small businesses making it less competitive (at the time).</p>
<p><strong>7. Sponsoring a blog</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MixRank did sponsored reviews with bloggers for sales leads, offering $2 or $3 for every sign up. Of course, there was transparency and full disclosure, but the risk was low for both parties. The risk for MixRank was whether the sign up would lead to revenue. For bloggers, they didn&#8217;t need to bet on, for example, making more money with this ad versus another, because this piece of content was a post not a banner ad.  As a bonus, sponsored reviews show up near the top in search engines, compelling bloggers to do a sponsored post.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sponsoring email newsletters</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Newsletters provided MixRank with a burst of traffic really quickly. It was also high quality traffic for lead generation, as newsletter subscribers are an audience that is willing to give up their email address for the right content or product.</p>
<p>Try out some of these steps to improve your lead generation and reach your target audience to help grow your revenue.</p>
