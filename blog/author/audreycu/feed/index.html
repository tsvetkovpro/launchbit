<p dir="ltr">An entrepreneur has the busiest job in the world. Between planning the menu, cooking the food and washing the dishes, their responsibilities include absolutely everything.  You can probably relate – I sure can. So it shouldn’t be surprising that one of the most common mistakes an entrepreneur makes is misallocating time and energy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most small business (especially starts-up through mid-sized companies), the focus needs to be on customer growth and increasing top line revenue. Without strong revenue generation and acceleration, a small business can go from profitable to unprofitable in an extremely short period of time. Here is a three-step combo to keep your business on the right track.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test the waters</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before spending your life savings and the next six months of your life on the next big thing, test out the market. Round up your potential customers and determine whether they would actually pay you. Remember…you can’t pay your bills with Facebook “likes”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s pretend I have a great business idea – animal hair dye. I think it’s an excellent idea and spend $10,000 producing 10 different colors and making sure it’s safe to use on animals. After 6 months of hard work, the product is ready to use and I’ve even tested it on a few different animals.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RUiKiHloE9ZJeNR59DU4e1qCNp9TFQq6Q_cgRHZzhzAuVAp2Z_n-K-Cv5KbWIwZplrsl-hPT00oKnQA3KiUv_ZVWwxE2qnW2rlnVV9YHvpP8HI7jHwDl7FDSyw" alt="" width="492px;" height="256px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">I set the date for the grand opening and eagerly wait for it to arrive. The day comes and…no one shows up! What a disaster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s see how this could have been avoided. Something as simple as a landing page can help you gauge interest and determine whether you have a viable business plan. An ideal landing page will help you collect email addresses and build up some hype so there’s a line waiting in front of your store when you launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cater to each potential customer</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s face it, we all like to feel like we’re special. But it’s true &#8211; the more a customer can relate to you, the greater chance you have of converting them. But what if you only have one product and you’re trying to market to multiple market segments?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back to our example. The animal dye idea didn’t work out, but perhaps a pet shampoo product will be profitable. This time I create a landing page and receive enough interest to warrant creating the pet shampoo. After another 6 months of hard work, I finish creating my product and name it Super-Poo 5000. It’s absolutely the best shampoo on the market for dogs, cat, hamsters, and parrots. Now comes time to market it. If you throw up a website and market to all of them at once, dog owners won’t want it since cats are involved, cat owners won’t want it since hamsters are involved, hamster owners don’t want it because….etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What you want to do is cater to each individual pet owner. So if I were running an email ad campaign on LaunchBit that focuses on dog owners, I would create an individual landing page dedicated for dog owners that speaks to the specifics of how the shampoo helps with something like dog grooming. Same for the cats, hamsters and parrots.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Focus on time-allocation</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In finance, the term “capital-allocation” refers to how to efficiently invest available resources. Let’s say you have $100 to invest between Project A and Project B. Both projects cost $100, and everything is the same except Project A expects to return 5% and Project B expects to return 8%. Obviously Project B is favorable. But in an otherwise similar comparison, entrepreneurs often make the same mistake with their time. I call this poor time allocation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t focus on menial tasks that don’t have a lasting impact on revenue. Focus on those that do. Instead of spending 20 hours debating what color your logo should be, hire a designer to come in for an hour or two – it’ll be cheaper and will look better. Leverage your strengths and outsource everything else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A service provider like <a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com/?utm_source=LaunchBit&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=jc">KickoffLabs </a>can help you create multiple landing pages to test your markets, generate leads, and cater to individual customers.

<p dir="ltr">Startup founders are often very creative and willing to take great risks to capture their audience’s attention. Some are more daring than others &#8211; but then again, if you do it right, what do you have to lose?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a> went out on a limb with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI">very profane slogan and a wacky video</a> that made their company famous. At the SXSW conference last year, ParkMe grabbed some buzz by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaKlbwAwpqs">putting fake boots on parked cars</a>. Yet BBH Labs was widely criticized for a stunt where they <a href="http://bbh-labs.com/homeless-hotspots-a-charitable-experiment-at-sxswi/">paid homeless people to carry around wifi hotspots</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We recently talked to David Hauser from <a href="http://grasshopper.com/">Grasshopper</a> to learn more about a stunt he pulled off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grasshopper1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-small wp-image-4685" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="grasshopper1" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grasshopper1-250x333.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="333" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about some of the creative marketing stunts you’ve done?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve always done all sorts of creative stuff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of people have obviously heard about the chocolate-covered grasshoppers. We sent out 5,000 bags of actual chocolate-covered grasshoppers. We didn’t send them to customers or anything like that. We sent them to influencers: everything from the media to popular people on Twitter to authors, and everyone in the United States Senate. We sent them to anyone we could think of that we count as being an influencer that would somehow touch our market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also created a video, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6MhAwQ64c0">Entrepreneurs Can Change the World</a>.&#8221; Part of that integrated campaign was sending out these chocolate-covered grasshoppers, but also driving towards a message which was encouraging entrepreneurship and getting entrepreneurs to Grasshopper.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What lessons did you learn?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When we look back at how we came up with these things, there are frameworks of what makes buzz. Some of this controversial stuff was ridiculous. But every time, what’s been successful for us is that we’ve gone to the extreme, and then backed off and found what the limits are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So take, for example, when we were doing the chocolate-covered grasshopper campaign. It was difficult; we might get arrested. We wanted to send live grasshoppers in the mail. Well, you can’t send live stuff in the mail. So let’s send dead ones; in Asia, you can buy them and the ones we got were huge with big eyes. So we backed off again until we got to the smaller, chocolate-covered ones that were still extreme, different, and controversial, but palatable enough that someone would actually try to eat it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, I think that’s the thing: knowing those limits.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What stunts have you pulled off recently? Anything controversial, yet acceptable?</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, we heard from Rick Perreault about how <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> started marketing their product before they even developed it. Today, we’re going to dive deeper into some specific tactics he used.</p>
<p><strong>How has personalization played a role in your marketing?</strong></p>
<p>I send a personal email from me, asking for their help so it isn’t just some generic Unbounce company email. It’s coming from me and I kind of lay out why I’m doing this and what I hope to gain out of this. I think our very first survey came from a generic Unbounce email, and we got some response, but we did a personalized one and the response rate was easily doubled.</p>
<p>People were more engaged. I received an email from someone just saying, “Hey, thanks for that personal email. This is awesome, and I love the fact that now I have the CEO’s email!” I was a little scared. I thought, “Oh boy, they’re going to have my email address,” and I thought maybe I’d be overwhelmed with just support questions. That’s only happened once in the last month, so it’s definitely working for us and I’d suggest testing it.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan out your next steps in marketing?</strong></p>
<p>We’re planning things out now, like with an editorial calendar for our blog. When we were in our initial startup mode, it was just about launching the product.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make good content that attracts people to your blog?</strong></p>
<p>We write a lot about best practices. We’ll do reviews of what we think some good landing pages are and of some landing pages that aren’t so good. We tend to focus on conversion rate optimization, but we cover general Internet marketing topics, as well.</p>
<p>Some people think, “Oh yeah, we want to get good search ranks, so we are just going to write all this content, or, you know, stick them on our website.” I’m not sure if that works or not, but I can tell you it’s not going to get shared. People share our content because they find it interesting, informative, and helpful.</p>
<p>I think if it’s not quality content &#8211; if you’re just putting content out for the sake of putting out content &#8211; it won’t get shared. We’ve seen posts that we’ve done when we know it isn’t as good as some of the other ones, and you’ll notice it doesn’t get shared as much. So really trying to make an emphasis to stay focused on creating something that’s of high quality.</p>
<p><strong>What is your approach and mindset as you’re trying to use various marketing channels efficiently?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think our approach had been traditionally a bit more “just get stuff out there.” Now, we’re definitely trying to truly understand what channels are working for us better. Most of what we do is measurable and predictable. But that still leaves us a lot of room to experiment and try new things.</p>
<p>For example, we’re doing a CRO chat every Thursday at 10 am Pacific Time (#CROchat for anyone who’s interested). You don’t know how many people are there paying attention. We don’t know today what kind of impact it will have on our business, but we certainly think it’s worth trying. . . . We’re there, engaged with others who are interested in conversion rate optimization, so it can’t all be bad.</p>

<p>It might seem strange to market something that doesn’t even exist yet, but that’s human nature. People are generally very curious. They’re willing to give away their email address to be the first to try something new, even if they have to wait weeks or months for it.</p>
<p>We talked to Rick Perreault from <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> about how they found their first customers. For them, creating great content on the Unbounce blog was their main marketing tool.</p>
<p>“We started marketing the day we started coding,” Perreault says. “We started our blog at the same time we started developing the product. This allowed us to attract people who were interested in conversion-rate optimization and online marketing.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 7 pm, you&#8217;ve just sat down for dinner, and the phone rings.</p>
<p>Setting aside your pasta, you pick it up: &#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pause, maybe a few clicks, and then you hear:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hi, there&#8217;s a person there! You&#8217;re the first real voice I heard all day!&#8221; or &#8220;Hi, may I please speak with Mrs., uh, Cue&#8230;Koo&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, you might either quickly say, &#8220;Sorry, I&#8217;m not interested,&#8221; or simply hang up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 7 pm, you&#8217;ve just sat down for dinner, and the phone rings.</p>
<p>Setting aside your pasta, you pick it up: &#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pause, maybe a few clicks, and then you hear:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hi, there&#8217;s a person there! You&#8217;re the first real voice I heard all day!&#8221; or &#8220;Hi, may I please speak with Mrs., uh, Cue&#8230;Koo&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, you might either quickly say, &#8220;Sorry, I&#8217;m not interested,&#8221; or simply hang up.</p>
<p>I once worked in the financial services industry, where my position heavily relied on making cold calls. It was just as discouraging to be the one placing the call, as it was annoying to be the one receiving it. You just hope for one successful call out of the 100+ that you make each day.</p>
<p>One day, I was with my colleagues from the same financial services agency, when I received one of those calls. I was about to hurriedly hang up, but my mentor told me to turn things around on the caller. So I heard him out. He spent a few minutes giving his spiel, and then I started talking to <em>him</em>. Not about his product or offering, but to him personally. I started giving my regular spiel. Before he even realized it, he had booked an appointment with me for the following week, and I was well on my way toward closing a deal! *high five*</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t deal with that many phone calls at LaunchBit, I do receive quite a number of unsolicited emails. Whether it&#8217;s people sending me cold emails to use their service or people who write to me by mistake (you know, like when your email selects the wrong address from the auto-fill), my inbox gets several of these a week.</p>
<p>So I thought, why not employ the same tactics that I was once taught on these email solicitors? It&#8217;s easy to delete unwanted emails, but you’d be missing a business opportunity. When we remember this at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, we turn the tables around on these SaaS businesses. We generally don’t have a reason to become their customer, but we ask them to become ours &#8211; to reach other potential customers. Turns out, if you ask, they just may be interested.</p>
<p>To date, we have converted some of these into advertisers. I would say that&#8217;s a sign of success!</p>
<p>The lesson? Your overflowing inbox can be a burden, or it can be an opportunity for your business. Some of those emails may be perfect leads delivered straight to you, with no effort on your part. These senders have emailed you, and you have the right to email them back. So instead of saying, “Sorry, I’m not interested” or “Please unsubscribe me,” give your spiel &#8211; and you may just land a customer.</p>
