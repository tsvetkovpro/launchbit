		<description>Love the T-shirt :) And good point about waiting on users for feedback. The question though is, after developing a version and while you&#039;re waiting for the part of the learning cycle that depends on other people, do you spend your limited time and resources pushing that version to users to speed up the cycle or do you test other ideas in parallel? For the parallel thing to work you have to make sure there&#039;s very little left you can do to speed up any of the tests you&#039;re already running, and there&#039;s always so much you can do!</description>

		<description>You provided an insightful story to distinguish what you called &#039;work time&#039; and &#039;calendar time.&#039; Within this framework, serial and parallel are two common development models. I have found that a third option provides a better model. An development effort under this strategy minimizes the time from concept to abundant new product sales. It maximizes efficiency, effectiveness, cooperation, and collaboration. In this preferred culture, someone who may have traditionally considered themselves a coder (or any other domain specialist such as designer, marketer, or writer) shifts to a new product developer that specializes in a particular programming language. In this culture, there are a significant number of T-shaped individuals that seamlessly move between disciplines so that they have a holistic view and a system impact - which includes abundant sales and positive word-of-mouth.</description>
