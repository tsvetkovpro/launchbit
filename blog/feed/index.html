<p dir="ltr">Growing up in the Bay Area during the dot.com boom, my co-founder Jennifer and I have long been inspired by entrepreneurs and the technology they build to better the world.  (But perhaps more importantly, as teenagers, we were enamored with how much pizza you were allowed to eat. <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )  In fact, we thought startups were so exciting that we began talking about starting a business together even as early as freshman year in high school!  And in our junior year, we made a pact that someday we would go into business together.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AzOduVxafA2-rbNqDmhL4BCcYkZPPE8MnyThpwxGffWegWOw6kjcKEt6OKMIl6F0p8JdiKnTLVvjz7dzxDr4TiRXAKHrOHvKK9XNpPiTcNXW6AsmMwXdnEiiNTsTXIqlmQ" alt="in500.png" width="580px;" height="351px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>At 500Startups in 2011</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">A decade later, LaunchBit would become that business, and along the way, we’ve had the opportunity to work with an amazing set of customers, employees, investors, and advisors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hDLKyBhE-nNzuA9y78dGXH2xndH75wOieAbOvAYaPlnR1nKAHyPTw1r1AoxDP7ezCkG2D-wbByA_blOZgtJ6D5vdP_RlX6rwdpEli_zxJ0aJkGB9FOxVJeW_43isCIrkZQ" alt="unnamed.jpg" width="514px;" height="385px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Our first team offsite</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Building an adtech company from just a handful of advertisers and publishers in 2011 to a few hundred advertisers and thousands of publishers on newsletterdirectory.co has been quite a journey.  Looking back on our journey, Jennifer and I are proud of how much our team has accomplished in the last three years.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0rVLBq58bWlAUYklduynQL_OJM8f_3OCfnleReWwpJJS5RfvHRG0GwKimWsuPveTHNMekXoDg1ejikGROKNE0Biyif42BQ1OUoPOotRL4IvtuYf3tZUlVcDHhWSOeNhqGw" alt="IMAG0137.jpg" width="250px;" height="419px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Sending our best advertisers and publishers packages for the holiday</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As we continued our growth, we started partnering with larger ad networks including a company called <a href="http://www.buysellads.com">BuySellAds</a> (BSA).  BuySellAds is a premium ad network that reaches high quality tech audiences including developers, designers, and entrepreneurs amongst a number of other categories.  Over time, in working closely with them, we realized we shared a similar vision for adtech and goals.  It made a lot of sense to team up with them.  So, today, I’m pleased to publicly announce that BuySellAds is acquiring LaunchBit and will continue to run our cost-per-click network just the same as always.  It was important to Jennifer and me that if we were going to sell our company, it would be to someone who would run the business like we would.  I’m confident that BSA is that company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So for Jennifer and me, this is the end of our journey with LaunchBit, but we’re on to new adventures.  Thank you so much for all of your support!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cheers,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elizabeth</p>

<p><strong>The Myth of Going Viral</strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, my team and I created a roommate-finding app appropriately named Roommates. In a nutshell, it was just like Tinder&#8230;but for roommates. After our team had built an amazingly awesome app, we needed users! To find users we ended up creating a series of infographics that were seen by hundreds of thousands of people and featured in Techcrunch, Huffington Post, Curbed SF, Venture Beat, The Next Web, The New York Observer, and dozens of other media outlets.  Our infographic for San Francisco, for example, well exceeded 250k views in less than one week.</p>
<p><strong>The Myth &#8211; Dude, let’s just go viral!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-03-at-6.38.31-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6198" title="Going viral" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-03-at-6.38.31-AM-700x480.png" alt="" width="490" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be THAT hard right? I mean, all we had to do was create any ole&#8217; thing, post it to Twitter/Facebook, and watch the users flock to us like startup nerds to a Noah Kagan blog post.</p>
<p><em>After years of experience, I&#8217;ve found that this is anything but reality.</em></p>
<p>But after creating a ton of infographics that have been shared tens of thousands of times and have been seen by hundreds of thousands of people, I’ve learned that there are three steps to increase your chances of creating a viral infographic.</p>
<p>These steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your goal and target audience</li>
<li>Create irresistible and sticky content</li>
<li>Distribute so you create an avalanche</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets dig into each step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Define your goal and target audience</strong></p>
<p>When creating an infographic it&#8217;s important to first ask yourself “Who&#8217;s this for and why am I doing this?”</p>
<p>I know, I know, it sounds silly but 90% of people completely forget this first step. It&#8217;s easy to fall into the vanity trap of chasing traffic for traffic’s sake, but to go viral and make it a success you need to have a “how” AND a “why.”</p>
<p>Ultimately what you need to realize is that the goal is always a share, but beyond that it needs to be a sale, email conversion, or PR.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.upworthy.com">Upworthy</a> &#8212; the king of going viral. It&#8217;s pretty clear what they want &#8211; your dam* email address, and who they want it from – liberal leaning hip young folks who like Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, make sure you have a “why” before creating your content. But whether it’s a sale or email, make sure to never be tacky or to “self-promotey”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span><br />
Before creating content we knew our target was 18 – 30 year olds who living in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and New York. The goal was to covered by a large media outlet like Huffington Post or Techcrunch and to get downloads. The easy part was that our product &#8211; an app &#8211; was free.</p>
<p>Did it work? Yes.</p>
<p><em>Remember: Write down your goals and target audience before doing any type of content creation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Create sticky content</strong><br />
What the hell does that even mean? I read a lot of blogs and there&#8217;s one thing SEO specialists and marketers constantly say: create good, shareable content.</p>
<p>I HATE when I see that advice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so bland. It&#8217;s like saying “be fast and strong” when someone asks how to run a 4 minute mile. Yeah, thanks a lot&#8230;GREAT advice.</p>
<p>So here’s the deal: humans are fairly predictable creatures. If you&#8217;ve read <em>Made To Stick</em> or <em>Contagious</em> then you know there&#8217;s a science to creating sticking content. And I&#8217;ve broken it down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Niches make riches</li>
<li>That&#8217;s SO me</li>
<li>Names, names, names</li>
<li>Be controversial, funny, or useful</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Niches make riches (if it rhymes it makes sense&#8230;no matter what)</span><br />
When creating content, it&#8217;s easy to try and appeal to everyone, but that mindset will only guarantee failure. In fact, you should do the exact opposite, which means create something that only a small, passionate group of care about rather than appealing to a large, apathetic group.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the top posts from from the subreddit r/programming. If you&#8217;re not a programmer chances are that not a single one of these article titles will make sense to you.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YiTVU9zPOWZIvKWQSwpA_SmNtaBqLvDu7BLNduEVKvzYsPlYNlzcosYErA6TE8BL3BczpDSMxIQp4O1JFi9_KW_2uxEtHimUbh-ojKyXbjSFkdnkYOMWNKWBhjru1nu07g" alt="" width="624px;" height="412px;" /></p>
<p>But check out how many times the 2nd most popular article has been shared.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1Imhq27aQ5JsujaVCEDbhLk8ry_lZs7f_XXzZSxLoFVVLazELOAW-8-YDajIskIiCLMJsFXeTSnC7ZQh46GydDLSbs7VcFTsEsdPYXsLX6Zu8ZNkOPRQZLTxvWE_99KDPA" alt="" width="624px;" height="236px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>408 times!</strong></p>
<p>Sure, the article doesn’t  mean much to YOU, but it does resonate with a small, passionate group of people – programmers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you don’t live in San Francisco then the San Francisco article will be pointless to you. In fact, even if you live in SF a lot of the jokes won’t make sense. To really understand each joke you need to live in the neighborhood we made fun of.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TnWO5Gl9UUDt-xkHuqoFOlgxTganrSPhnY4E54saIGVEXPit37GVJ5BtpG1mEIJ9tfLaUqNUYLsljNY4awWZPD3kqgJxK9b7c0N-BFi526AZMZnyEdc1fdLoou_H__kuDA" alt="" width="435px;" height="383px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">You won’t get this joke&#8230;unless you’ve lived in The Marina neighborhood in SF.  <strong>Remember: If you try to appeal to everyone you&#8217;ll appeal to no one at all. Create content that&#8217;s insightful or funny for a very small, passionate group of people, not a huge, apathetic group.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. That&#8217;s SO me!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Similar to the Niches Make Riches theory, when writing sticky content you want readers to identify with your content to the point where they say “Wow, this is so me!” or “I know someone JUST like this.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/F75Ic2i_gVGqAhDGW8MtPNCJngh4I7pVkHsn7pPH06IAdlQRhacBvX-HAiiXszn7WIcX05BuWhPnDt3N6qXKILFAa_zKLpEYE8c7nC8ZVoMnVYjVrTt5td_9mUaufCE6Sw" alt="" width="624px;" height="415px;" /></p>
<p>People want to share something that represents themselves or their friends in a funny/cool way. It&#8217;s not rocket science. It feels good to laugh at yourself. Just look at just about any Buzzfeed quiz. Title’s like “What Friend’s character are you” or “10 ways you know you’re from Boston.” People feel special when they see something that represents themselves online&#8230;and they’ll wanna share it!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We created stereotypes for each neighborhood in San Francisco and predicted where they worked. Because we picked such popular employers, it was inevitable that many people who lived in that neighborhood also worked at the employer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h8dz8rQTq5hjt0riSG1wbHKbMmG8G3Bjb7vn5XzB2ORd_7HBKvXut20vJl1Havc7c8ZFVoWD3yWZeKWxLNCXQYxQILohFEO0DrDlkRfrjU6nTb3C4dIou_GpfVdeOlNK1A" alt="" width="624px;" height="227px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Names, Names, Names</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoover Adams was the founder of <em>The Daily Dunn</em>, the local newspaper in Dunn, North Carolina. It&#8217;s one of the most successful newspapers in the country – on average, every household buys 1.12 copies (apparently couples don&#8217;t know how to share). When asked what his secret was, Adams said he&#8217;d had the same strategy for 40 years. It boiled down to three things: names, names, names.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What people wanted, Adams discovered, was to see their name and their friend&#8217;s names in the paper. “If I could” Adams once said, “I&#8217;d publish pages from the phone book.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o0UwbO1RTyG21CpR4gk4ZsTYp1HxfV_8saEKFjjVh_fdvi_Xm1OHUZE6ndcZgTz3EpvL2WsVwcfTeKtTaxdTvkiK3x1wFDhhbl7yQqGwBT7Z4mn2XmKbvITxKbfh9LwTCQ" alt="" width="381px;" height="285px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoover Adams</p>
<p> A person&#8217;s name is the most beautiful sound in the world. Not only do people LOVE reading about themselves, they also love reading about the people/things they know and identify with. This concept is perhaps the most powerful on this list because the people you mention in your content will almost always share the content with their followers. I like to call these people “stakeholders.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made sure to always specifically name employers, restaurants and people, because not only did they share the content, but their fans did as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BHiAxP4V0p6qOVIbS1xFd8eDbjgNtL5BQyhUHeTS6t6uU5oEHk5mhf8IV_Y5jWKDf4jJ3RrppnlGxzt0pqUhZIFIa9qrFj5kqw8yxzEx37HM4Odlpff-jmnwEo1eQgrH4A" alt="" width="441px;" height="385px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Examples of how we’d name specific companies</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MDVH9GjietVM6hLz2FawMmq_Cp0GPlQolKyA5rB30Rc6Eh-XsShDzXMEZuizS9O98VNAHXmOQ_iiKAEE2CXC7dnTo36lZmozCc4_BxJYJhvfjjQom8k_5CAt6zTf80XMHQ" alt="" width="607px;" height="291px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Be controversial, funny, interesting, or useful</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is easier said than done and if done incorrectly you can really hurt your brand – so be careful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you provide value, like being funny or useful, people will share your content. For example, if you’ve found this article helpful I hope you’ll share it <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Check out Neil Patel&#8217;s famous <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-seo/">Advanced SEO Guides</a>. They are crazy helpful and also extremely popular.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NEVER try to make a homophobic or racist joke. Sure, some people have pulled it off in a funny and tasteful way, but the risk of it failing is too great. And never make your content sad. It&#8217;s been proven that the most shared content is typically happy and uplifting, not depressing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9kIk9OpeKY66L92jyfo8j5K15xet6P-SmVQRo_zwhfXR1EDAMlxGuHo_7HbK5_RDqHC_c-txTz1TDcbTG245UQJCeyqfF7mduLndQ6WPWSO6qpQ5zxrA-RWW_8AAOSKCtw" alt="" width="336px;" height="131px;" />      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jgm9rznw57Ye-tOgnHed7Mr5UnW10VmHBi8Zr1jBGNIAg3O06AL3E62KS0OCBXjpm1BX0sMDvZHoE0F0AuxMoY9IzvcS-Fh61FZiGWMauG2lnaF6Y1YQB1cl8vS6H5UjXQ" alt="" width="247px;" height="163px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fun tip: Need help brainstorming? Check out these places</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Yelp</strong>: I&#8217;ve never been to New York, but I helped create a popular infographic about New York neighborhoods. I was able to do this because I read every review for the most popular places on Yelp to understand the culture. Always check out the most popular, highest reviewed, and lowest reviewed places on Yelp and read the comments for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Gold. There&#8217;s a subreddit for everything. Check out the highest votest threads of the past week, month, or year for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Top posts from other blogs</strong>: if you have a target audience in mind, check out other blogs they read and find the top posts. Use this as inspiration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Step 3. Distribute</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok, so now you&#8217;ve got some sticky content. Now what?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Distribute!</p>
<p dir="ltr">You&#8217;re not Kevin Costner and this isn&#8217;t Field Of Dreams. One of the biggest misconceptions in content creation is if you create it, people will magically come – but this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going viral is like an avalanche and rarely an accident, once it gets started it builds up and gets bigger and bigger&#8230;but you&#8217;re responsible for the first step.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are my favorite three ways to distribute your sticky content:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Reddit/Hacker News/And similar sites</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">They say that Reddit is the front page of the internet&#8230;and I completely agree. The most popular memes, trends and internet jokes typical start at Reddit. With over 100 million monthly unique visitors, Reddit is a fantastic place to kick off your viral avalanche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The key to succeeding on Reddit is finding the right subreddit. You should only post your content in a relevant subreddit, otherwise you&#8217;ll be accused of spamming.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BJYlYt6NmfQipKts_M_DQKpLusWTdEqjqtTsnQ56A658_9hNCOGKLPEKdJyRmZKga4qLkJI2zyYjy0k8PO0M9gFBMGltqE6jEBQ3P6k2D5irwXmkjahaacpazhIJ9wOaCw" alt="" width="624px;" height="216px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">When creating the Roommates&#8217; infographic, Reddit was always the first place to post. But be careful&#8230;if you post too much you&#8217;ll be accused of spam, and you cannot delete people&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fAF4y2ZeGSN4tq6WBfz15-uWJsKu3BZNDeiZjC8-oH7StzxQMr6qFuSztQ2VNENvIG1fKh8MwKICYY2l0AWMk8Fsipe8LjsJSrewQBe4BxAlwiNnfLo09-aCHyumx5HZGA" alt="" width="431px;" height="263px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Other sites similar to Reddit are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker News</li>
<li>Digg</li>
<li>Product Hunt</li>
<li>Inbound.org</li>
<li>GrowthHackers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember when we talked about the importance of naming specific people, places, and companies? Well, we may have had a sneaky little reason behind exactly who we named.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9uMmUe23hRl6iExcsb8XgSRkABhRfz8TGgBODS9I49KK-TwlIWBvGzwT6Jrb9gdgyI0Yo-5ybYCgAfpka6AAhMvPapEX4f-YHk55H0_TsxPYvArUvFQctpgAaxawpvI4Sw" alt="" width="183px;" height="187px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">When creating viral content, it&#8217;s important to work backwards. Rather naming funny people in your content and hoping they&#8217;ll share, you should find people who: have a large following and you know they&#8217;ll share.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stakeholders will naturally share things they&#8217;re mentioned it. It feels good to be mentioned online&#8230;so they&#8217;ll want others to know.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we applied this to Roommates</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made sure to only mention people who had at least 5,000 Twitter followers. This wasn&#8217;t an exact science, but over time we realized it worked. Before launch day we&#8217;d list all the stakeholder&#8217;s Twitter and Facebook handles. When the big day came we simply Tweeted at them and post on their wall. 9/10 times people retweeted or shared with their followers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1qOhhSDdciBdhB8V4zC5_pdjkJJhFnQIVRoMEfvLU1bk1-TaouEXx_WQm7cDNrOwdvIlDrDdAmZ8EZMFKyKFFYxFUwLHIc4GBV9gG_WfwISDsEBUOxEBpcfUUyptW07wuQ" alt="" width="624px;" height="216px;" /><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ol5l6t5nE7pnerEZth3qAJLZNDT02bAs58UtgMTkywnGIciCcZljhL85raE3ceqOrAn0u6T9TTzeWM27qoKEkCiHNLp1vf-rx4MMalUrBDjZI66fpE8fLd7pAbatYw7vZg" alt="" width="575px;" height="319px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Big Media and Influencers</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Big media coverage or retweets from big names can make or break your viral launch. I like to break this category into two sections: big media and influencers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Big media</strong>: Getting coverage from Techcrunch, New York Times, or Huffington Post can be huge. Not only will this type of coverage create a trickle down effect and convince other blogs/media to write about you, but you&#8217;ll also capture huge amounts of residual traffic months or even years after your initial launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The good news is that most of the journalists from big media will troll Reddit for popular stories, which is yet another reason why you should post your content on Reddit. Additionally, big media likes to follow smaller blogs for story ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want media coverage, I suggest emailing small blogs first and working your way up the chain. This can be a tricky thing and if you want to become an expert at this then I suggest reading Ryan Holiday&#8217;s book <em>Trust Me I&#8217;m Lying</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But beware: 7/10 times big media will screw up your article. Whether they write incorrect information or forget to link to your site, it&#8217;s important not to solely count on big media.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVEr5CCmqRnmsczlB5m3QsND1s_on_a3Kt9Pc1VWyqciAKiOmTMs6ImyeMx8QuH8WRrnpgMhP8onl2MV4NVwyhgvhAnL29oCnUYoQCW7S28kaQdt7LL7aHjs5FXe-58QLQ" alt="" width="624px;" height="277px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Influencers: Similar to big media, influencers will have a similar trickle down effect. While influencers may not have as much traffic, chances are their following is more loyal and they&#8217;re easier to contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2XpvesmNIT7dahlUtrYse4ZU8Nf8q5hkxf2luWW5xMDvH--vnsMv0NvLaOA1Ng_1VYr-XKh8uPLndzOXarDPceL7L96snjfENnISZqGpI949cyxSdzd-Yu-VTEP-pjKOkQ" alt="" width="512px;" height="152px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, there you have it.  This is how I was able to manufacture hundreds of thousands of views on my infographics.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Editor&#8217;s note: </em>For more great tips on viral marketing from Sam, check out his conference <a href="http://www.hustlecon.com">Hustle Con</a>, which is on August 1 in San Francisco.  The focus of this conference is to teach scrappy ways of doing customer acquisition.  Although it&#8217;s geared towards startup founders, who often don&#8217;t have the luxury of attention and press whenever they want, every marketer will learn a TON at this event.  You will learn about other viral marketing mechanisms, such as how Rohin Dhar, the CEO of Priceonomics, grew his blog from 0 to 2.3M monthly visitors with content creation.  Full disclosure: LaunchBit organized the conference last year and this year serves as an advisor.</p>

<p>When SaaS was new about a decade ago, a lot of companies added a free plan. At the time, having a free plan was a nearly free marketing strategy, because it attracted product signups. These days, however, free SaaS plans are no longer unique. And in fact, for many SMB-focused SaaS companies, a free plan may not even make economical sense.</p>
<p>So, with the combination of free plans becoming harder to market and the rise in SaaS companies addressing the SMB market, I was curious if freemium was still popular amongst SaaS companies?</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be impossible to analyze every single SaaS company. So to get a snapshot of the SaaS landscape, I decided to take a look at companies in the SaaS marketplace <a href="http://www.getapp.com/">GetApp</a>. I took a look at a handful of categories: Business Intelligence Software, Customer Management Software, Marketing Software, and Sales Software. Specifically, I looked at the first page of featured companies in these categories.</p>
<p>I found 3 interesting insights:</p>
<p><strong>1) Most SaaS companies (in this dataset) are not freemium!</strong></p>
<p>Given all the talk about free plans in SaaS, I was surprised that most of the SaaS companies I looked at did *not* have a free plan. However, as recently as last month, the Harvard Business Review called freemium the &#8220;<a href="http://hbr.org/2014/05/making-freemium-work/ar/1">dominant business model</a>&#8220;.  But, this just isn&#8217;t as true as people think.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.18.47-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6174" title="Business Intelligence Freemium breakdown" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.18.47-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Business Intelligence category had the lowest percentage of SaaS companies that had free plans &#8211; a mere 12% of companies in this category offered a free plan. The Sales and Marketing categories were just slightly higher at 16% and 20% freemium respectively.</p>
<p><strong>2) The Customer Management category is the exception.</strong></p>
<p>However, the customer management category has a lot more SaaS companies with free plans. A whopping 32% of companies in this category were freemium. You could speculate why this might be. Salesforce is the behemoth in this category. The other categories don&#8217;t have a dominant player with the same level of legacy and revenue that Salesforce has. It&#8217;s possible that other companies in this category may be trying to use free to gain some ground on Goliath.</p>
<p><strong>3) &#8220;Near free&#8221; may be the new freemium.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.19.51-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6175" title="Customer Management Software freemium breakdown" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-12.19.51-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Customer Management category also has a couple of companies that have a &#8220;near free&#8221; package. Namely, you pay just $1 per agent per month. $1?? That&#8217;s super cheap &#8212; that&#8217;s just about free. Yet, it requires you to input your credit card in order to use this package, making it easier for these companies to upsell you later.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: It&#8217;s unclear how GetApp chose to feature companies for each category.  Interestingly, a lot of well known companies or rising startups were notably missing from all of these categories.  In addition, many of the categories had companies that provided a couple of different offerings.  Zoho, for example, has a number of products, and all of their products are free.  So, including multiple products from the same company skews the results as well.</p>
<p>Shortcomings of the data aside, this is a good snapshot of how a number of  SaaS companies may be thinking about freemium.  Marketers may be finding freemium to no longer be a good business strategy.  Does this surprise you?</p>

<p>Ever notice that when you post to your Facebook page, your posts don&#8217;t reach most of your Facebook followers (people who have Liked your Facebook page)? How does Facebook decide who to show your Facebook posts to? We&#8217;ve been trying to reverse-engineer this algorithm.</p>

<p>Ever notice that when you post to your Facebook page, your posts don&#8217;t reach most of your Facebook followers (people who have Liked your Facebook page)? How does Facebook decide who to show your Facebook posts to? We&#8217;ve been trying to reverse-engineer this algorithm.</p>
<p>In our last post, we showed that there actually are <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/ideal-time-post-facebook/">ideal times to post to Facebook</a> (at least for us at LaunchBit).  In today&#8217;s post, we&#8217;ll analyze whether there&#8217;s an ideal day of the week to post to Facebook. Note: this again is using our data at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>First, I plotted the reach that each of our posts achieved against day of the week. (n=180 posts)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/impression_by_week.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6153" title="Impression Reach by Day of the Week" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/impression_by_week-700x272.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Then I took the average reach of each day as well as the overall average (mean) of the whole dataset.  I did this excluding the two outliers (outlined in pink above).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-9.36.40-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6157" title="Average impression reach by day of the week" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-09-at-9.36.40-AM.png" alt="" /></a>The overall mean for the total dataset (excluding the 2 outliers) is 35.6.  The dataset also does not have a normal distribution.  (Normal as in the statistics definition of the word)  The standard deviation for the whole dataset is 28.5.  If it were normal, it would mean that almost every post would reach between -50 and  121.1.  But, reaching a negative number of people is just not possible on Facebook. <img src='http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, just from eyeballing these numbers, you can see that no particular day of the week garners greater reach than others.  The average reach for each day of the week is within 3 impressions from the overall mean.</p>
<p>In plain English, <strong>it does not matter what day of the week we post</strong>.  Have you found that certain days have greater reach than others for your Facebook page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook is a black box to marketers.  If you post to your company page, your post often won&#8217;t be shown to everyone who has Liked it.  At <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>, we currently have 264 Likes on our company page.  But, when we post to our page, you can see that most of the time, not even half of our audience sees our posts.</p>
<p>A lot of marketers claim there&#8217;s an ideal time to post to Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Contact </strong><a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/product-blogs/social-media-marketing/best-time-post-facebook/">suggests that 6:30-8:30am</a> (unclear of the timezone) is optimal for them, because people see their posts when they wake up and check their phones.</li>

<li><strong>Constant Contact </strong><a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/product-blogs/social-media-marketing/best-time-post-facebook/">suggests that 6:30-8:30am</a> (unclear of the timezone) is optimal for them, because people see their posts when they wake up and check their phones.</li>

</ul>
<p>It seems that the right time differs for everyone.  So we decided to analyze our own data.  (n=189)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-05-at-12.57.08-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6133" title="LaunchBit reach by time" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-05-at-12.57.08-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Here are our 189 posts over the last couple of years plotted by time and reach.  On first glance, the data appears to be all over the place.  (Note: the definition of &#8220;reach&#8221; is the unique number of people who see a given post on Facebook.)</p>
<p>But, with a more in-depth look, there are a couple of interesting findings:</p>
<p><strong>1) Our top posts were posted between 1-4pm PT</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Top_quartile_posts1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6136" title="Top Quartile Posts" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Top_quartile_posts1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I took the top quartile of posts with the greatest reach and categorized them by time.  This is represented by the blue bars.  For example, you can see that 11 of my posts with the greatest reach were posted between 3-4pm.</p>
<p>Then I graphed how many posts you would expect to be in the top quartile for each duration of time if time were not a factor in Facebook&#8217;s reach algorithm.  This is shown by the red bars.  Here&#8217;s the interesting part: where the blue bars are significantly higher than red bars indicates where time has helped our posts get more reach.  In this case, the top posts tended to be between 1-4pm PT.</p>
<p><strong>2) The bottom quartile of posts were posted between 8-9am and 4-5pm</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bottom_quartile_posts.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6137" title="Bottom quartile posts" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bottom_quartile_posts.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I used a similar approach with the bottom quartile of posts.  I categorized the posts with the worst reach by time, and this is represented by the blue bars.  For example, 12 posts in this quartile were posted between 8-9am.  The red bars represent the number of posts you&#8217;d expect in each time bucket if time were not a factor in determining reach.  So, where the blue bars significantly are higher than the red bars are the worst times to post.  In this case, between 8-9am and 4-5pm were the worst time periods to post.</p>
<p>The takeaways here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our best time to post is between 1-4pm PT.</li>
<li>Our worst time(s) to post are 8-9am PT and 4-5pm PT.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t know anything about posting between 7pm-7am, since we&#8217;ve never done this before.</li>
<li>Your data may show something different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, we should always try to post between 1-4pm to give ourselves the best shot at maximum reach.</p>
<p>Do you know when is the best time for you to post to your Facebook page?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I last wrote about whether doing <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads/">lead generation on a small blog</a> is worth the effort.  Surprisingly, I found that it&#8217;s not a bad investment of time, because you do the work once, and then you reap the benefits there on out. When I published this post, someone on <a href="http://quibb.com/links/how-can-small-blogs-generate-organic-email-leads">Quibb</a>, asked me how our blog efforts compare to all our other content marketing efforts in generating leads.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our content marketing activities at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a> and how they compare against each other. (Note: Our content marketing pales in comparison to efforts of much larger software companies, so this is by no means what is considered optimal &#8212; it&#8217;s just how we do things at LaunchBit)</p>
<p><strong>Webinars: 100-600 leads per webinar</strong></p>

<p>Webinars are by far one of our best content marketing activities.  Typically, we&#8217;ll partner with a complementary company, create slides together, and share the webinar time.  Both parties will promote the webinar through email marketing, encouraging people to sign up, and these leads are shared between the two companies.  As such, we don&#8217;t partner with companies that have aggressive email marketing.  We make sure that we have a solid fit with a company before deciding to partner with them.</p>
<p>Webinars are a lot of work, though. Putting together slides, coordinating meetings to decide content and rehearse, and finally doing post-production on a video all takes time &#8211; probably about 20-30 hours in total.  We are not currently doing lead generation on the webinar videos we generate, so this activity currently does not yield subsequent lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>Blog: 100 leads per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6103" title="Blog" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14045819341_6651d70343_z-640x426.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="http://www.manoftaste.de/" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="25">www.manoftaste.de</a></em></p>
<p>We mentioned in our last post that we are currently generating about 30 leads per month (roughly 100 leads per quarter) on our blog.  We have blogged as often as 4x per week but currently blog 1-2x per week.  Each blog post takes approximately 2-4 hours to write and edit.  If we blog once a week for a whole quarter and can drive approximately 100 leads, then blogging starts to rival a webinar.  Unlike webinars which just generate one tranche of leads, blogging can potentially lead to greater, continuous lead generation if we can continue to increase traffic to our blog.</p>
<p><strong>eBooks: a handful per quarter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6105" title="ebooks" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9367687811_2927cd5d02_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Our eBooks, in general, don&#8217;t yield a lot of organic leads.  <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/improve-the-roi-of-your-content-marketing-recap/">Paid marketing works well for eBook signups</a>, especially through LaunchBit&#8217;s integrations with publisher partners.  But, as far as free leads go, we only get a handful in a given quarter.  In part, our eBooks also tend to be hidden on their own special landing pages that are disconnected from our website.  eBooks also take a lot of time to put together.  They can take 2-4 weeks of calendar time and about 80 hours of work, including design, writing, editing, and formatting.  That said, because eBooks are great for generating paid leads, they are worthwhile if you are running paid campaigns (and we are).</p>
<p><strong>Books: unknown</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6106" title="books" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7357608430_64f9ea5260_z.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Lastly, we are currently writing a &#8220;regular book&#8221; on email marketing. Unlike an eBook, regular books tend to be higher quality, and in fact, we&#8217;re going to be selling our book on Amazon.  The email marketing book we&#8217;re writing has taken a couple years of calendar time and about 300-400 hours of design, copywriting, and editing&#8230;and still counting.  We are not sure whether this activity is worthwhile for lead generation, but we have decided to give this a shot, because we had enough content to write a solid book.  We hope you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a great book, too!</p>
<p>In short, webinars are currently the best organic lead generation activity for us, but based on the trajectory of our blog traffic, we expect our blog lead generation to overtake webinars in the next few months and show greater ROI for our content creation time.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I read a great post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2014/03/11/get-first-100-email-subscribers/">How to get your first 100 email subscribers</a> by Bryan Harris for <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan&#8217;s blog</a>. The author placed leadboxes around his blog and shared where he was able to get the most email signups for his email newsletter.</p>
<p>We were curious and decided to conduct a similar experiment for the last month (5/5-5/26). In fact, we straight up copied some of his ideas. In particular, what we wanted to know was whether these lead generation ideas would help us even though we have a small blog.  We get between 1000-6000 blog visitors a month.  Here are our results:</p>
<p><strong>1) Byline leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We replicated this idea directly from Bryan.  For every post, we wrote a &#8220;byline&#8221; telling people to &#8220;Get updates of new posts here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6055" title="Byline lead generation" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline.png" alt="" width="465" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>When someone clicks the byline a leadbox pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6056" title="Byline lead generation popup" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/byline2.png" alt="" width="447" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Bryan talks about a 0.6% conversion rate with this lead capture method on his blog, but it&#8217;s unclear to me whether this is a conversion percentage based on total impressions of the byline link or of the popup.  Regardless, for us, we had a 0% conversion rate &#8211; no one signed up!</p>
<p>That said, the click-through-rate on the byline link was quite low at 0.09%.   So, split testing this method would not be worthwhile for us.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Post-footer leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also placed a leadbox below each blog post encouraging people to sign up for our email newsletter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6057" title="Footer leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.17.53-PM.png" alt="" width="468" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>The results on this leadbox were fairly poor.  In May, seven people subscribed to our newsletter via this box.  There were across 4183 non-unique impressions of this footer box in May.  This method of lead generation probably isn&#8217;t worth optimizing, because even if we 10x-ed our results, the conversion rate would still be low.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.2% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Sidebar leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox on the upper right side of our blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6058" title="Sidebar leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.28.48-PM-700x291.png" alt="" width="490" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>The byline and footer leadboxes were fairly hidden, so to be honest, I didn&#8217;t expect them to do very well.  But, I did expect this sidebar lead generation box to perform a lot better.  However, we saw just 1 conversion!  The results were even worse than the footer leadbox.</p>
<p>Bryan uses a sidebar leadbox that scrolls as a reader is reading a post and achieved an 0.8% conversion rate on his blog.  If we were to modify this sidebar leadbox, we would likely try a similar strategy with a auto-scrolling box.  I speculate that perhaps our blog visitors are not interested in signing up to read more posts until they&#8217;ve actually read one first, so an auto-scrolling box might help with conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.02% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Header leadbox</strong></p>
<p>We also placed a leadbox at the top of our blog.  This header leadbox, however, did/does not show up at the top of specific blog posts.  It only shows up on our blog synopsis page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6060" title="Header leadbox" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-27-at-12.41.46-PM-700x293.png" alt="" width="490" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the ideal placement (you cannot possibly miss this!), I&#8217;d expected this leadbox to do quite well.  However, this leadbox received 0 signups!</p>
<p>Like the sidebar widget, perhaps, if this header appeared after someone read one of our posts, then it might perform better. A future experiment might be to show this header leadbox on specific blog posts and scroll as a reader reads a post.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0% conversion</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) Timed pop-up leadbox</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we implemented the <a href="http://sumome.com/">SumoMe</a> leadbox for our blog.  This leadbox pops up in the middle of the blog after a certain amount of time.  It shows up on any of our blog pages.  Compared to all the other leadboxes we&#8217;ve tried, this popup performed the best.</p>

<p>Bryan was able to get a 5%+ conversion rate on his blog.  Although our conversion rate was not nearly as high, these results are definitely at a good point to start tweaking.  In less than one month, we were able to get 19 new email signups from this one tactic.</p>
<p><strong>Results: 0.7% conversion rate</strong></p>
<p>Although a total of 27 new leads across all five tactics is not a lot, if we leave them up for the next 2 months, we&#8217;ll be able to hit 100 new subscribers from organic traffic for just a couple of hours of work that it took to place these leadboxes on our site.  With some tweaking of the leadboxes, we might be able to get some multiple on email signups as well.  And obviously if we can grow our blog, that will lead to a multiple in signups as well.</p>
<p>I was initially skeptical that a small blog like ours could get a significant number of leads from these different tactics.  And while a larger blog could achieve so many more leads for the same amount of work, the results haven&#8217;t been bad for us.  A lot of B2B companies value email signups at $5-$30 per lead, and we&#8217;re no different.  For a small blog like ours, we now see that a couple hours of work leads to recurring $100-1000 in new value per month.  Trying these leadbox tactics has been worthwhile, and I would recommend giving some of these ideas a whirl on your own blog for your own email marketing program.</p>
<p>What leadboxes do you use on your site?</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m writing a book on email marketing for data-driven marketers.  It&#8217;s basically a <em>Moneyball</em> for email marketing.  If you want a free copy when it comes out, sign up here:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that we&#8217;ll be releasing a book on email marketing in June! This is a book that we&#8217;ve been working on for a very long time based on data from across thousands of email lists.  (Even though the current cover says only my name, this book was written by my colleagues Audrey Cu, Zachary Tong, Jennifer Chin, and me.)</p>
<p>A few things about this book:</p>
<p><strong>1) This book is for data-driven marketers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6035" title="Data" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b-700x522.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" /></a></p>

<p>A few things about this book:</p>
<p><strong>1) This book is for data-driven marketers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6035" title="Data" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8016192302_0e9c4b7170_b-700x522.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" /></a></p>

<p>There is too much fluff in marketing. There are too many so-called experts who want to give you advice on marketing best practices that are not grounded in anything. Our book is all about data. If you don&#8217;t enjoy looking at charts and graphs, this book is not for you.</p>
<p><strong>2) This book goes against the grain.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2546359596_d8445fd573_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6036" title="Grain" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2546359596_d8445fd573_b-700x451.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="361" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sidewalk_flying/2546359596/sizes/l">mykonos</a></em></p>
<p>Some of the advice that we&#8217;ll share in our book goes against common wisdom in marketing.  Our advice, again, is based on data. And we found that sometimes data suggests that you do something opposite to common wisdom. We don&#8217;t cater to the crowds, so if you want a book that discusses common marketing wisdom, this book is not for you.</p>
<p><strong>3) Our analyses are our own opinions.</strong></p>
<p>We are a very data-driven team. We look at numbers &#8211; a LOT.  In this book, to help you digest what the numbers mean, we&#8217;ll give you our interpretation of the data. That said, we will also be upfront with you about how strongly the data backs our opinion.  In some cases, we may not have enough data to conclusively argue for a particular case, and we&#8217;ll be frank with you about that.  We will try to lay out all the caveats we can think of since we aim to be as objective as possible. You will see both the data and our opinions and will be able to draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>4) This is not just some fluff marketing ebook.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7574100516_eca9106ed0_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6037" title="Fluffy clouds" src="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7574100516_eca9106ed0_b-700x393.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="314" /></a></p>
<p><em>image credit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flynn_nrg/7574100516/">Miguel Mendez</a></em></p>
<p>We have spent 2 years building up to this book. And, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time writing, revising, and editing. Even though it&#8217;s being produced by a corporation, this is not some gimmick. This is a real book. <strong>And our aim is to make this the very best tactical, data-driven, marketing book you&#8217;ve read in a long time &#8212; it will be that good.  </strong>Even if you are a super experienced marketer and an email marketing expert, I think you will learn a lot from the data we&#8217;ve collected.  And certainly those who are new to email marketing will get a lot out of this book as well.</p>
<p><strong>5) Best of all, I am making this book free&#8230;but only for one week.</strong></p>
<p>The book isn&#8217;t done yet. Heck, the title is even a work in progress. But when it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m going to release it for free for one week. After that, we&#8217;ll charge for it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s going to be that good.  We&#8217;re giving everyone fair warning, so don&#8217;t come crawling to me in July asking me for a free copy of the book.  I don&#8217;t care how close we are &#8212; even my mom won&#8217;t get it for free after that one week.</p>
<p>So, make sure you don&#8217;t miss that free week.  Sign up below to get notified when we launch it. We are aiming to get this book done in the next month or so.</p>

<p>Twitter cards are essentially apps that run within <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. One type of card that is particularly interesting to marketers is the Twitter Lead Generation card. We&#8217;ve previously written about <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-use-twitter-cards-for-b2b-lead-generation-3/">how to set it up</a>, but what can you do with it? How do you use it to encourage people to sign up for your email mailing list? 3 clever ideas we&#8217;ve seen:</p>
<p><strong>1) Thank</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them. Ryan realized this was an opportunity to encourage people to sign up for his mailing list so that he could continue to reach these people with subsequent posts that might be useful to them.&#8230; <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/3-hacks-generate-leads-twitter-cards/" class="read_more">Read the rest</a></p>

<p><strong>1) Thank</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> founder Ryan Hoover started building a following for his blog. People would inevitably retweet his posts or favorite them. Ryan realized this was an opportunity to encourage people to sign up for his mailing list so that he could continue to reach these people with subsequent posts that might be useful to them.</p>
<p>So, he created a Twitter Lead Generation card for his mailing list, and each time he thanked people on Twitter, he encouraged them to also sign up for his mailing list.</p>

<p>The neat thing about this approach was that with one-click, people could easily sign up to receive subsequent posts, and he was engaging with an audience that wanted to hear from him.  <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/67662891557/grow-your-email-list-with-this-simple-twitter-hack">Read his full post on this here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Run a contest</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockcreek.com">Rock/Creek</a> uses Twitter Lead Generation Cards to increase signups for their mailing list. They generated 1700 leads in one week for a contest that would give away a new pair of sandals.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/lead-generation-card-now-available-to-all-advertisers-with-new-features">Read more about how they did this here &gt;&gt; </a></p>
<p><strong>3) Giveaways and freebies</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you can give freebies to people who sign up for your mailing list. We&#8217;ve seen everything from free icons/images/clip art for designers to free coffees to free content. A cautionary note: if you&#8217;re trying to maximize your ROI on your email signups, you probably want to give away something that is aligned with your business. Giving away a free coffee as a B2B business might not attract the most relevant leads. But, giving away designer files or templates if you&#8217;re aiming to reach designers would be a great offer.</p>
<p>How have you used Twitter Lead Generation Cards?  Has it been effective?</p>

<p>A lot of companies talk about how to build a data-driven company cultures. And while this is important (and something we explicitly wrote in our company values at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>), we found that we needed to get more specific and tactical for our marketing team.</p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong><br />
My co-founder Jennifer and I are very data-oriented people. In day-to-day conversations, we&#8217;ll build arguments with facts and experiments.  We both are engineers by training, and I even TA-ed and tutored basic statistics at MIT.

<p>A lot of companies talk about how to build a data-driven company cultures. And while this is important (and something we explicitly wrote in our company values at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com">LaunchBit</a>), we found that we needed to get more specific and tactical for our marketing team.</p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong><br />
My co-founder Jennifer and I are very data-oriented people. In day-to-day conversations, we&#8217;ll build arguments with facts and experiments.  We both are engineers by training, and I even TA-ed and tutored basic statistics at MIT. Data is really important to us and something we naturally wanted to explicitly write into our company values. And we did.</p>
<p><strong>You must turn your philosophy on data into action</strong><br />
But, even if you&#8217;re data-driven in personality, it can be very easy to not carry-through in your team dynamics.</p>
<p>In 2011, when we first started LaunchBit, we would look at our numbers religiously. We would carefully keep track on spreadsheets our conversions for everything.  From conversion rates of investors (even down to the category of investor: gender, race!) to conversion rates of our customers, we would track it. But slowly over time, by 2012 and early 2013, we were getting sloppy. Especially on the customer acquisition front, which is what I own here at LaunchBit. We had so many experiments going on that we got to the point where we had too many spreadsheets floating around, and it was tough to keep track of everything! If you have too many dashboards and accounts to check, at some point, you stop checking them and forget all about them. After a year or so, it basically became one big bear.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="bear" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5488/10055709303_bc0c985ede_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="512" /></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tambako/10055709303/sizes/z/">tambako</a></em></p>
<p>So I stopped taking a look at all data. I feel sheepish in saying that I used to chastise people for not looking at their Google Analytics accounts or knowing their numbers. But, guess what &#8212; it&#8217;s very easy to not check when you have so many experiments going on and too much data to check.</p>
<p>So, we regrouped and realized we had a mess on our hands. We had too many experiments that were running, forgotten about, and we needed to end the ones that were not working. We needed a better way to structure experiments.</p>
<p><strong>How we structure experiments today</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Experiments" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8193079579_0684a7abb9_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p><em>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mobilestreetlife/8193079579/sizes/z/">mobilestreetlife</a></em></p>
<p>We are now much more methodical about marketing experiments at LaunchBit. Here&#8217;s how we structure them.</p>
<p><em>1) We hold a standing product meeting each week to talk about our experiments.</em><br />
Everyone involved in customer acquisition is in this meeting plus head of product (Jennifer). We spend half the time discussing the status of existing experiments and the other half of the time developing new experiments. These experiments are generally small: in 1-2 week sprints.</p>
<p><em>2) We use Google Docs to keep a running list of experiments</em><br />
When we create a new experiment, we&#8217;ll come up with a structure and rough timeframe. For example, when <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/blog/how-to-increase-traffic-to-your-blog-post-by-100-using-twitter/">we tested Twitter headlines</a>, we determined:</p>
<ul>
<li>What our hypothesis was &#8212; e.g. we&#8217;d be able to find a statistically significant headline</li>
<li>How many headlines we were going to test</li>
<li>On what schedule to tweet our headlines</li>
<li>What data we needed to see if our hypothesis was correct</li>
<li>How we would track and document data</li>
<li>What timeframe we would run the experiment for</li>
</ul>
<p>We would then set action items and respective owners for the week to make progress on this experiment.</p>
<p><em>3) We discuss experiments still in play on a weekly basis</em></p>
<p>Each week, for experiments that are near or past their expected timeframe, we determine whether to kill, continue, or expand the experiment &#8212; this is probably the most important part. All too often experiments are not very conclusive, so you need them to run longer than initially expected. This is where experiments often go to the land of the dead, because people lose track of them. We decided that we needed to take an active stance in monitoring experiments and actively decide an experiment&#8217;s status. If we decide to continue an experiment, it gets another timeframe added to it as if it&#8217;s a new experiment.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why experiments often end up in a limbo zone is that you rarely have breakout results either way.  Much like how you don&#8217;t want your company to be in the <a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/are-you-running-a-zombie-start-up.html">land of the walking dead</a>, you don&#8217;t want your marketing experiments to be here either. Having too many experiments build up in the zombie zone makes for unmanageable experimentation. So, eventually, all experiments must have a definitive end, and the only way to ensure this is to put strict timelines on experiments so that you can actively review.</p>
<p><strong>There is an opportunity cost to having too many experiments</strong></p>
<p>What is often unspoken is that there is an opportunity cost to having too many experiments. You have limited time to manage and actively tweak a certain number of experiments. By putting time constraints on experiments, you are forcing your existing experiments to compete against new experiment ideas you may have. Each time you want to extend the lifetime of an experiment, you are actively deciding against doing a new potential experiment, which means you believe that the current experiment has a better shot at &#8220;winning&#8221; than something else you could be trying.</p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to build a data-driven marketing team</strong></p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re a data-driven person, it can be difficult to build a data-driven team as you scale. One of the reasons our data-collection fell apart in the first place is that chaos started occurring as we started expanding our team and number of activities, etc. Chaos is natural in startups and fast-growing teams. And it&#8217;s the antithesis of structure, which is exactly what you need to be data-driven. You can still be speedy and data-driven with structure. But, to initially put that in place requires taking a step back and spending the time to put processes in place.  That requires taking a momentary pause, which causes a lot of people to cringe, but it&#8217;s worthwhile in the long-run.</p>
