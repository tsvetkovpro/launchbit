		<description>Hey Jennifer &amp; Elizabeth, I guess that a job offer with a probation period would only really work if the candidate is a gun at her abilities and you are extremely confident in her contributions.</description>

		<description>Hi Tehnyit -- good question.  We&#039;ve never tried a probation period, so I honestly don&#039;t know what the differences would be.  But, that said, I would guess that setting up a probation period would be more complicated, because I would have to first hire them and deal with payroll/benefits/HR + equity and then stop all of that if I let them go?</description>

		<description>Interesting. Just wondering how different this strategy is when comparing to having a probation period? Perhaps the time duration of the contract?</description>
