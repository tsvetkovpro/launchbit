		<description>Hi!

Thank you for the post again! Valuable information!

I am having trouble with our e-mail deliverability in the last months, and have made some mistakes while trying to fix it. Now trying to set a fresh start and work our way to the inbox again.

We delivered e-mail from 3 different sender domains (top country TLD&#039;s that also local websites are hosted on) based on users locale, for example &quot;brand.fr&quot; for french users, &quot;brand.it&quot; for italian and &quot;brand.co.uk&quot; for UK users (each in their own campaign with different content). In total about 35.000 subscribers, sending campaigns twice per week.

Been using Mailerlite with shared IPs as e-mailing service till recently. For 2 years, we were having gorgeous results with consistent inbox landings, open rates of 30%+ and click rates of 5%+ for every campaign. Then about a month ago, about 10 consecutive campaigns went to Promotions tab and about 2 even to spam. First we checked e-mail content with testers and cleaned our lists, nothing. We tried fixing this by changing the sender domain to &quot;brand.eu&quot; for all the locales (not the best move) and sending again, got about same results. Desperate by the results we even tried switching the platform to Sendy+Amazon SES and again used the &quot;brand.eu&quot; sender domain - all our e-mail got to Gmail spam. G-Lock apps also marks our test sent mail as spam by Google Apps Postini filter. Mistakes made, lessons learned. DKIM+SPF authentication was handled and taken care of all the time + using personal and text-only e-mails with high scores on delivery testers (mail-tester.com 9.5), so I assume the sending domain or IP reputation was the main issue.

Now did tons of reading on e-mail deliverability, IP&amp;domain reputation, adapting content etc. Now setting up an Account with Dedicated IP to isolate reputation at sendinblue.com and making a plan to start from scratch and warm it up properly.

My questions are:

1) Should we use old, original domains (brand.fr, brand.it,..) we used for sending all the time for sender/sending domains and try to fix their reputation (Google Postmaster says its Medium). How long does it take to try to fix reputation?

2) OR is it better to use a perfectly fresh domain (newly registered, e.g. brand.deals) to start of along with a perfectly fresh IP also? That should provide a clean start in theory, right? (would still send gradually to best portions of the list only to warm up the new IP)

3) With the last sending from sendinblue shared IPs, we segmented lists to Active, Medium Active, Less Active based on previous click rates, and sent them separately. The results were better as some campaigns (the active lists) even made it to Primary inbox, but a couple still in spam (based on statistics and testers). So I consider this a good strategy, and my plan is to purchase and use even use 2 separate dedicated IP&#039;s - one for active lists only and one for less active lists only. That way we would make sure the most active lists stay in primary inbox if cleaned periodically. Does this make sense (based on our sending volume about 500.000 e-mails monthly)?

Thankyou!</description>

		<description>[...] The publisher responded to our recommendation, and as it turned out, they recently changed their  subscriber acquisition user experience.  This resulted in an increase in signup conversions by 4x!  So, even though their open rate on  newer signups has dropped as much as half, their 4x increase in new subscribers makes up for the lower quality subscribers.  On the outset, this seems like a win for them.  Our one caution would be to carefully monitor spam complaints.  They are currently on shared IP addresses, so if their spam complaints increase, they may be forced to share &#8220;dirtier IP addresses&#8221; with true spammers.
