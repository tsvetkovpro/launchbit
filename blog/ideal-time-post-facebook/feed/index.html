One more thing I have for eternity unspoken is that computer systems have become a product that all residence must have on behalf of a lot of reasons. They equip you with well-situated behavior in which to systematize the home, compensate bills, turn shopping, report, tweak in to music and in countless cases consider box series. An innovative performance to all-embracing mainly of these tasks is a computer. These desktops are portable ones, petite, robust and convenient.</description>

		<description>Hi Stephane -- to be clear, this isn&#039;t a predictor of engagement.  This is a measurement of Facebook&#039;s reach numbers for each post.  In other words, how many people they decide to *show* my post to.  I don&#039;t think you determine why Facebook to show my posts... :)  This analysis merely shows there&#039;s correlation between time and impression reach.</description>

		<description>Food for thought Elizabeth :
What is the reason why 1-4pm is working best for you. Is it because it&#039;s the timing that was perfect or is it because at these specific times, you&#039;ve posted content that engaged more than usual? Or is it because of the type of content?
It&#039;s very difficult to assess. Our algorithm, for example, ranks more than 60 variables in predicting the success of a post. Day and hour being only 2 of them.

Best,
Stephane</description>
