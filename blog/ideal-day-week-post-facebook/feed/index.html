		<description>Hi Stephane -- agreed.  We would need to sample a lot more times and days to see if any were correlated with reach.  To be clear, this post is about whether there are any times that we&#039;ve tried to date that is correlated with reach.  And, it&#039;s specific to us.</description>

		<description>Hi Elizabeth,
nice insights. Unfortunately, no social media manager alone can find the perfect time by him/herself.
Why?
Because you can&#039;t just look at your past performance only. To be statistically correct, you would need to post the exact same content every hour, every day of the week. Even doing this, some biases would remain (external factors).
That&#039;s why we&#039;ve created Wisemetrics (www.wisemetrics.com) Come have a look and tell me your opinion. :)</description>
