		<description>Hi Rachel, 

Absolutely correct.  Opens are tracked when people display images, so yes, if you have people opening who are not displaying images, then you don&#039;t want to accidentally get rid of them.  The best way to clean your list is to take a tact like this: 

http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/03/04/classy-fab-stops-sending-you-emails-you-dont-read-even-when-you-dont-ask-them-to/

Email everyone who looks like they haven&#039;t opened at least once in a few months and tell them that you will be unsubscribing them unless they take action.  We do this with our list, and it&#039;s actually a great way to get people re-engaged.  We found that there are a number of people who always re-subscribe and also write in saying that they love being on our list.</description>

		<description>Re: cleaning email list...

I was told that I can&#039;t always rely on the open data since it only triggers that someone has opened an email if they enable the images which triggers the tracking info.

So, isn&#039;t it possible that there are people opening my emails, but it&#039;s just not being registered?

Wouldn&#039;t it be a mistake to delete emails based on opens if this is the case?

Thanks!</description>
