		<description>Very good approaches! Here&#039;s another one: Remember the lessons learned and don&#039;t repeat mistakes. How? Simply by writing a &quot;startup story&quot; - including all lessons and experiences - that can be reviewed/reflected regularly by all team colleagues. The more team members contribute, the more valuable this information will be in the future. A simple (closed) blog or wiki is enough to get started, but there are also special tools for this purpose (e. g. teamspir.it).</description>
