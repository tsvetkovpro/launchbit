		<description>nia, this is something we can all rtlaee to. There isn&#039;t enough tme to read and respond to everyone, and the more comments and followers you get, the harder to keep up. So don&#039;t worry about it, just keep it fun.I&#039;ve had to pull back a bit because it became too much to keep up with all my favorites, so i stopped the mails and just come in and scroll down the reading list and stop by one or two blogs to catch up on what they are doing, like now with you. Sometimes I will just scroll down the front page of a favorite blogger, reading or looking at pictures and enjoying several days worth of posts, while only leaving a few likes or comments.So don&#039;t feel bad. No one can keep up with everyone all the time. But it&#039;s always nice to see you when you do stop by, just know that you are appreciated, but not expected to do the impossible. ((hugs))</description>

		<description>The problem is the so called &quot;native ads&quot; are just another gimmick. People learned to ignore banners, and then learned to ignore adword type text ads, and they will learn to ignore native ads as well. I&#039;ve seen examples of Outbrain native ads on cnn - and most of the links are junk that looks like it should be interesting content and fools you, but once you get to the site you quickly leave it. Once fooled once, you avoid such gimmicks in the future.
The only thing that people are looking for is real content, not advertising and biased material - so just like banner ads this idea will fail.</description>

		<description>We have stopped automatically judging our display ad performance by solely click through rates. For us, we find it more insightful to review our campaigns success by cost per sale. Whilst not particularly relevant to brand marketers just looking for exposure, we have found that a quality scent trail and a custom and carefully considered landing page can still have a sales conversion rate that proves the worth of display advertising. We have detailed our own views on succeeding with DA&#039;s here, so if you guys fancy it, take a look. http://www.zeta.net/display-ads-arent-dead-learn-how-to-succeed-with-your-display-campaigns/</description>
