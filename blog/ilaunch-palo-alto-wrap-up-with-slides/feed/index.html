		<description>Elizabeth &amp; Jennifer,Loved your talk last night!  I learned so much(seems like I&#039;ve been under a rock or something.)  I&#039;m totally obsessed with Mechanical Turk now.  I&#039;m waffling between being a turker myself for fun and using MTurk to outsource my current job ;o).  I&#039;m super excited about practicing the lean start up model and using the tools you talked about.  In fact, you&#039;ve inspired me to start an early Entrepreneur night of my own for people to get together to work on their ideas. Thanks so much!-kim</description>
